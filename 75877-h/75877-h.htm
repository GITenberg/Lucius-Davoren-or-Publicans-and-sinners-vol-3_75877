<span class="fs70">HOW GEOFFREY ENJOYED THE GARDEN-PARTY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">While</span> Lucius Davoren was thus occupied at the
east end of London, Geoffrey Hossack was making
the best of an existence which he had made up his
mind to consider utterly joyless, so long as adverse
fate denied him the one desire of his heart. For him
in vain warm August skies were deeply blue, and
the bosky dells and glades of the New Forest still
untouched by autumn’s splendid decay. For him
vainly ran the bright river between banks perfumed
with wild flowers. He beheld these things from the
lofty standpoint of discontent, and in his heart called
Nature a poor creature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>‘I would rather be mewed up in Whitecross-street
prison, or in the Venetian Piombi, with Janet for my
wife, than enjoy all that earth can give of natural
beauty or artificial splendour without her,’ he said to
himself, when his cousins had bored him into a
misanthropical mood by their insistence upon the
charms of rural life, as exemplified at Hillersdon
Grange.</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid you have no soul for Nature,’ said
Belle, when she had kept Geoffrey on his feet for an
hour in the cramped old-fashioned hot-houses, where
she went in desperately for ferns and orchids, and
imitated Lady Baker on a small scale.</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid not—for Nature in flower-pots,’ answered
Geoffrey, with an unsympathetic yawn. ‘I
daresay these Calopogons, and Gymnadenia, and
what’s-its-names are very grand, but I’ve seen finer
growing wild in the valleys on the southern side of
the Rocky Mountains. You English people only get
nature in miniature—a poor etiolated creature. You
have no notion of the goddess Gea in her Titanic
vigour, as she appears on “the other side.”</p>

<p>‘Meaning America?’ said Belle contemptuously,
as if that western continent were something too
vulgar for her serious consideration.</p>

<p>The sun shone upon Lady Baker’s fête as gaily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
as if fine weather had been a matter within her
ladyship’s power of provision, like the luncheon
from Gunter’s, or the costumes for the tableaux
vivants. The lady herself was radiant as the sunlight.
Everybody had come—everybody worth receiving,
at any rate. She gave Geoffrey a smile of
particular cordiality as she shook hands with him,
and murmured the conventional ‘How good of you
to come early!’</p>

<p>Belle and Jessie were speedily told off for croquet:
a sport for which Geoffrey professed an unmitigated
dislike, in a most churlish spirit, his cousins
thought. Thus released from attendance on these
fair ones, he roamed the vast gardens at large, finding
solitudes in that spacious domain, even on such
a day as this. In these secluded walks—where he
only occasionally encountered a stray couple engaged
in that sentimental converse which he slangily denominated
‘spooning’—Mr. Hossack indulged his
own thoughts, which also were of a spooney character.
Here, he thought, Janet Davoren had been
happy in the brief summer-tide of her life; here she
had felt the first joys and pains of an innocent girlish
love; and here, alas, had given that peerless blossom
of the soul, a girl’s first love, to a scoundrel.
The thought of this filled him with a savage jealousy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>‘I wish I had fired that shot out yonder instead
of Lucius,’ he said to himself. ‘Egad, I’d have
made sure my ball went through him. There should
have been no shilly-shally about my fire.’</p>

<p>Luncheon found Mr. Hossack more attentive to
the various Rhine wines than to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pâté de foie gras</i> or
chicken-salad, or even the wants of the damsel who
sat next him. He was out of humour with all the
world. His artfully-worded advertisement had appeared
several times, and had produced no response.
He began to think the Fates were opposed to his
happiness.</p>

<p>‘I suppose if a man is pretty well provided for
in the way of three-per-cents he must hope for nothing
else from Fortune,’ he thought, as he punished
her ladyship’s cabinet hocks.</p>

<p>Luncheon over, Mr. Hossack conducted his damsel
to the sunny greensward, where enthusiastic
archers—seven-and-twenty ladies to five gentlemen—were
stringing their Cupid bows for a grand match.
Here he shunted her into the care of one of the
five male archers, all of whom looked ineffably bored,
and anon departed, whither he cared not—anywhere,
anywhere out of this world of luncheons, croquet,
flirtation, and frivolity.</p>

<p>Wandering at random, he came by and by to an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
obscure outskirt of the Mardenholme grounds, given
over to the cultivation of huge rhododendrons, where
there was a little wicket-gate opening into a green
lane. He made his escape from Mardenholme altogether
by this gate, glad to get away from the polite
world, as represented by the croquet-players and toxopholites,
and above all by those exacting first
cousins of his, Belle and Jessie.</p>

<p>The green lane was rustic and secluded, well
sheltered from the westward sloping sun by spreading
boughs of chestnut and sycamore, with here and
there the grander bulk of an oak, making an oasis
of deep shadow in the afternoon sunlight. Altogether
a pleasant lane, even for the indulgence of
saddest thoughts.</p>

<p>It was on the side of a hill. Right and left of
him stretched undulating meadow-land, small enclosures
between those straggling unkempt hedges
which make the glory of English landscape, and
below, almost at his feet as it were, lay a little village
nestling in a cup-shaped valley, so snugly sheltered
by those gently-sloping meads, so fenced from
north and east by those tall screens of foliage, that
one might fancy the bleak winds of winter must
roll high above those modest roofs, ruffling no leaf
in those simple gardens; that hails and snows and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
frosts must waste their fury on the encircling hills,
and leave this chosen nook unassailed; that even the
tax-gatherer must forget its existence.</p>

<p>There were about half a dozen cottages, the perfection
of rusticity—gardens running over with roses,
beehives, honeysuckle; a village inn, so innocent
and domestic of aspect that one would suppose nothing
could be farther from the thoughts of its patrons
than strong drink of any kind; a little high-shouldered
old church, with a squat square tower
and crumbly whitewashed wall; a green burial-ground,
all ups and downs like the waves of the
sea, overshadowed by two vast yews, whose never-withering
foliage canopied those rustic graves from
January to December.</p>

<p>There was a little patch of greensward in the
midst of the scattered houses, and some feet below the
churchyard, no two edifices in this village being on
the same level. Here a meditative donkey cropped the
soft herbage at leisure, and here on the bosom of a
crystalline pool swam half a dozen geese, untroubled
by forebodings of Michaelmas.</p>

<p>It was altogether a deliciously rustic picture, and
Geoffrey, for the first time since his return to Hampshire,
felt reconciled to Nature.</p>

<p>‘This is better than all the tigered orchids in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
Lady Baker’s collection,’ he mused, as he perched
himself on a stile and took out his cigar-case for a
quiet smoke. ‘Why do great ladies cultivate lady’s-slippers
and pitcher-plants when for less money they
might surround themselves with model villages and
happy peasantry? Has the rôle of Lady Bountiful
gone quite out of fashion, I wonder?’</p>

<p>He lighted his cigar and meditated upon life in
general, dreamily contemplating the cottages and
wondering about their inmates, as he had often wondered
about the inhabitants of the dull old houses in
the dull old country towns. These cottages seemed
above the ordinary level, cleaner, brighter, more
prosperous-looking. He could not fancy wife-beating
or any other iniquity going on within those
homely plastered walls. Those twinkling diamond-paned
lattices seemed transparent as a good man’s
conscience, and in most of these dwellings the outer
door stood wide open, as if the inmates invited inspection.
He could see an eight-day clock, a dresser
decked with many-coloured crockeryware, a little
round table spread for tea, a cradle, a snug arm-chair,
a wicker birdcage, a row of geranium pots—all the
furniture of home. He felt that he had alighted
upon a small Arcadia.</p>

<p>While he sat thus musing, slowly smoking, very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
loth to go back to the civilised world, pert country
cousins, and tableaux vivants, and tepid ices, and
classical music, and general inanity, the door of
that solitary cottage whose interior did not invite
inspection was suddenly opened, and a child came
skipping out—a child who wore a broad-brimmed
Leghorn hat, with long yellow tresses streaming
beneath it, and a pretty holland pinafore, and displayed
symmetrical legs clad in blue stockings—a
child after the order of Mr. Millais.</p>

<p>Geoffrey made as if he would have fallen off the
stile; the half-smoked cigar fell from his hand. For
a few moments he sat transfixed and statue-like, and
could only stare. Then, with a sudden rush, he
darted across the little strip of green, and clasped
this butterfly child in his arms.</p>

<p>‘Why, it’s my little Flossie!’ he cried rapturously,
smothering the small face with kisses, which the little
maiden received without a murmur. Had not Mr.
Hossack endeared himself to her by all the arts of
bribery and corruption, in the shape of costly French
bonbons, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éditions de luxe</i> of popular fairy tales and
German hobgoblin stories, and mechanical white
mice that ran across the floor, and mechanical mail-coaches
that, on being wound up, rushed off at
breakneck speed to nowhere in particular, and came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
to grief after a few headlong journeys? ‘It’s my
precious little Flossie! My darling, where’s mamma?’</p>

<p>‘Mamma, mamma!’ screamed the child, looking
back towards the cottage. ‘Come out and see who’s
come.’ And then, turning to Geoffrey again, she
said with childhood’s candid selfishness, ‘Have you
brought me some more French bonbons in a box
with a picture on the lid, like the last?’</p>

<p>‘My sweet one, I ought to be provided with a
box of that very description,’ replied Geoffrey, grasping
the little maiden’s hand and dragging her to
the cottage; ‘but how could I anticipate such bliss
as to find you here in this O-for-ever-to-be-sanctified-village?’
cried the lover, coining a Germanic
compound in his rapture. ‘Is mamma in there?
O, take me to her, darling, take me!’</p>

<p>Tableaux vivants, pert cousins, Lady Baker, the
claims of civilised society, all melted into thin air
amidst the delight of this discovery. He was as unsophisticated
as if he had been a Blackfoot, brought
up in the pathless hunting-grounds of the West.</p>

<p>‘Take me to her, thou dearest child,’ he exclaimed;
and the little one led him into the cottage
garden, where the bees were humming in the sunset,
the air sweet with roses and carnations, happy swallows
twittering in the eves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>Here, on the threshold of the cottage door, framed
like a picture by the stout black timbers, stood that
one woman whom his soul worshipped, tall, slender,
lovely, like a goddess who for a little while deigned
to walk this lower earth.</p>

<p>She looked at Geoffrey with a tender gladness,
a wild surprise, opposite feelings curiously blended
in the expression of that eloquent face.</p>

<p>‘O, Janet,’ said he, ‘how could you be so cruel
as to run away from me?’</p>

<p>‘How could you be so unkind as to follow me?’
she asked reproachfully.</p>

<p>‘I have not followed you. ’Twas chance that led
me here this afternoon. There is a providence kind
to true lovers, after all. I did not follow you, Janet,
but I was heartbroken by the loss of you. I went
down to Stillmington to carry you what I dared to
think good news.’</p>

<p>‘Good news!’ she repeated wonderingly.</p>

<p>‘Yes, the tidings of your freedom.’</p>

<p>Janet’s pale face grew a shade paler.</p>

<p>‘Come in for a little while,’ she said; ‘we cannot
stand here talking of such things. Flossie, run
and play on the green, darling; I’ll come to you
presently. Now, Mr. Hossack.’</p>

<p>She led the way into the simple cottage room,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
spotlessly clean, and with that dainty brightness of
furniture and whiteness of drapery which industrious
hands can give to the humblest surroundings. It
was a small square room, with two of its angles cut
off by old-fashioned corner cupboards whose shining
glass doors displayed the treasures of glass and
china within. A dimity-covered sofa, a couple of basket-work
arm-chairs, an ancient bureau of darkest
mahogany, and a solid Pembroke table formed the
chief furniture of the room. One of Flossie’s fairy-tale
books—Geoffrey’s gift—lay open upon the table,
the mother’s workbox beside it. A bowl of cut flowers
adorned the broad sill of the long low casement,
and the afternoon sunlight was filtered through the
whitest of dimity curtains. To Geoffrey this old
room, with its low ceiling sustained by heavy black
beams, was perfectly delightful.</p>

<p>‘Do you mean to tell me that my husband is
dead?’ asked Janet, when she had brought her
visitor in and shut the door, looking him full in the
face with grave earnest eyes.</p>

<p>Geoffrey quailed beneath that searching gaze.
In this crisis, which involved the dearest wish of his
heart, he had become the veriest child.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ he answered, ‘he is dead. It is a most
extraordinary story, and as I have no evidence to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
prove my statement, you may be inclined to doubt
me. Yet I pledge my honour—’</p>

<p>‘I shall not doubt your honour,’ said Janet, with
a superb smile, ‘but I may doubt your discretion.
How do you know that my husband is dead?’</p>

<p>‘I met him in America, and heard of his death
there—heard it on the highest possible authority.’</p>

<p>‘You met him in America. Why did you not
tell me that at Stillmington?’</p>

<p>‘Because I had at that time no means of identifying
Matchi, the man I met in the West, with Mr.
Vandeleur. I have seen your husband’s portrait
within the last fortnight, and I can take my oath
that Mr. Vandeleur and the man I knew in America
are one and the same.’</p>

<p>‘Where could you see my husband’s portrait?’
asked Janet incredulously.</p>

<p>‘Lady Baker showed me a photograph of a group
in which you and Mr. Vandeleur both appear.’</p>

<p>‘Have you no other reason to suppose that this
American traveller, whom you call Matchi, and my
husband are the same, except the evidence of a
photograph?’ asked Janet, somewhat contemptuously.
‘What more common than an accidental resemblance
between two men who are utter strangers to each
other?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>‘Not such a likeness as that which I am speaking
of; nor is a genius for music the commonest
thing in the world. The violin-playing of the man
in the western pine-forest exactly resembled that
which Lady Baker described to me.’</p>

<p>‘What,’ cried Janet, with a wounded air, ‘you
have been taking Lady Baker into your confidence?’</p>

<p>‘Forgive me, Janet. I am bent upon bringing
this matter to a happy issue. Lady Baker is your
true friend. She bitterly reproaches herself for her
part in bringing about your unhappy marriage; she
went to Melksham in search of you, when she accidentally
learned that Mr. Vandeleur had been seen
there, and was deeply grieved at arriving too late to
find you.’</p>

<p>‘She is very good,’ answered Janet, with a sigh.
‘And now tell me about this man you met in America.
Tell me everything, without reserve.’</p>

<p>Without reserve; that would be rather difficult.
Not for worlds—no, not even to secure his own happiness—could
Geoffrey Hossack betray his friend.</p>

<p>He told his story as best he could; but in his
fear of saying too much, stumbled a little over the
details. Altogether the story had a garbled air, and
before he came to the end he saw plainly enough
that Janet was unconvinced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>‘I can trust your truth,’ she said, looking at
that frank honest face with her clear eyes, ‘but I
cannot trust your judgment. You had but just recovered
from a fever, in which your senses had
been astray, when you heard of his death. He was
shot, you say, in the forest. Who shot him?’</p>

<p>‘I—I cannot tell you,’ faltered Geoffrey, in a
cold perspiration.</p>

<p>This Janet understood to mean ‘I do not know.’</p>

<p>‘See how vague your information is,’ she exclaimed,
with an incredulous laugh. ‘You were
told that he was shot, but you were not told who
shot him; you were not told the motive of the murder.
Even in the backwoods I suppose people do
not shoot each other quite without motive.’</p>

<p>Geoffrey stood before her dumbfoundered.</p>

<p>‘Did you kill him yourself?’ she asked, with a
sudden flash of suspicion.</p>

<p>‘No, I wish I had; there should have been no
mistake about it then.’</p>

<p>‘Say no more, Mr. Hossack; this is a subject
upon which you and I can hardly agree. When
you can bring me direct and legal evidence of Mr.
Vandeleur’s death, I will believe it.’</p>

<p>‘And if I ever can do that—and from the
manner of his death it is almost impossible—you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
will give me some reward for my fidelity—eh,
Janet?’</p>

<p>‘I will make no bargains,’ she answered gravely.
‘I beg you to hold yourself entirely free, and for the
sake of your own happiness I trust you may speedily
get rid of this boyish infatuation.’</p>

<p>‘Boyish!’ echoed Geoffrey, with the proud consciousness
of his eight-and-twenty years. ‘Why I
am your senior by two years. Lucius told me so.’</p>

<p>‘Sorrow does the work of time in some lives,’
said Janet, with her sad smile; ‘I feel myself very
old at six-and-twenty. Come, Mr. Hossack, you
have been always very good to me, and for once in
a way I will treat you as a friend. Little Flossie is
very fond of you, and I know she is dying for a long
talk about her new pets, the tame rabbits and the
tortoiseshell kitten, whose acquaintance she has made
down here. Stop and drink tea with us, and tell
me how you happened to find me out in this quiet
corner of the earth.’</p>

<p>‘You forget that we are not a mile from one of
the gates of Mardenholme,’ said Geoffrey, enchanted
at the prospect of drinking tea with his goddess.</p>

<p>‘True; but I didn’t think you knew Lady Baker.’</p>

<p>‘Didn’t you?’ said this Jesuit, in an artless tone.
‘Why, you see my people live down hereabouts—Hillersdon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
Grange—and my cousins and Lady Baker
are uncommonly thick.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Bertram called to Flossie through the open
window. The child was walking up and down the
little path by the beehives, nursing her tortoiseshell
kitten. She came bounding in joyfully at this
summons, and exhibited this feline treasure to Mr.
Hossack, that good-natured individual allowing the
small member of the tiger tribe to make a promenade
upon his outstretched arm, and pur triumphantly
from a lofty perch on his coat-collar.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bertram rang a little tinkling handbell, and
a decent old woman—who must surely have been
what is called ‘upon the listen,’ or she could hardly
have heard that feeble summons—appeared with a
tea-tray, and spread the neat little table with the
best china teacups, a brown home-baked loaf, the
yellowest of butter-pats, the richest of cream in a little
glass jug, a great wedge of golden honeycomb, a few
ripe apricots nestling in a bed of mulberry leaves,—a
repast at once Arcadian and picturesque.</p>

<p>‘But perhaps you may not care for such a womanish
beverage as orange pekoe,’ said Janet doubtfully,
as Mr. Hossack surveyed the banquet from his
altitude of something over six feet, the kitten still
promenading his shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>‘Not care for tea! Why, on the shores of the
Saskatchewan the teapot was our only comfort,’ exclaimed
Geoffrey. ‘We had a cask or two of rum
with us, and had no end of trouble in hiding it from
the Indians; but they got the most of the fire-water
out of us sooner or later, by hook or by crook. We
rarely took any of it ourselves, except as a medicine.
Travellers are a temperate race, I can assure you,
Mrs. Bertram.’</p>

<p>They sat down to tea, the kitten now perambulating
the backs of their chairs, now sending forth
appealing miaws for milk or other refreshment.
Geoffrey, who had been too much out of humour
with the world in general to do justice to Lady
Baker’s luncheon, was ravenous, and devoured bread-and-honey
like the queen in the nursery rhyme, of
which Flossie did not fail to remind him. It was the
first meal he had ever eaten with the woman he loved.
That fragrant tea was more intoxicating than Lady
Baker’s choicest Johannisberger or Steinberger.</p>

<p>He forgot that he was perhaps no nearer a happy
issue to his suit than he had been that day in the
botanical gardens at Stillmington, when he made
his first desperate appeal to his inexorable goddess;
he forgot everything except the present moment—this
innocent rustic interior, the fair-haired child,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
whose gay laugh rang out every now and then, the
perambulatory kitten, the perfect face of the woman
he loved, smiling at him with that proud slow smile
he knew so well.</p>

<p>‘So you went back to Stillmington,’ Janet said
presently, when Geoffrey had appeased the pangs of
hunger with the contents of the honeycomb and the
crustiest side of the home-baked loaf, and had consumed
three cups of that exquisite tea.</p>

<p>‘Went back!’ repeated Geoffrey; ‘of course I
went back. I should have gone back exactly the
same if Stillmington had been in the centre of Africa,
or on the top of Elburz. How cruel of you to leave
no address! They told me you had gone to the seaside.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I did not leave a very definite account of
myself, certainly. You see I was so tired of Stillmington
and of my pupils; and thanks to concert-singing
and pupils, I had contrived to save a little
money. So, as my health was not quite so good as
it might be—I had been working rather hard for the
last few years, you see—I thought I would give myself
a month or so of thorough rest. I had a fancy—amounting
almost to an irresistible longing—to
see my old home once more—the graves of those
dear ones my ingratitude had wronged. I knew that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
to come back to the scenes of my girlhood would be
the keenest suffering, yet I longed to come. I did
not want to be very near Wykhamston, as that would
be to run the risk of recognition; but I wished to
be somewhere within the reach of the dear, dear old
place. I thought of this village and of Sally, my
kind old nurse, who came to live here in this cottage,
which she had bought with her savings, when she
left the Rectory. I was only fourteen when she left
us; and one of our greatest treats—Lucius’s and
mine and the dear sister we lost—was to come here
of a summer afternoon and drink tea with dear old
Sally. So I said to myself, “If God has spared my
old nurse, I will go and ask her to give me a lodging;”
and Flossie and I came straight here—to this
out-of-the-way corner—to take our holiday. Flossie
has been enraptured with the rustic life, the pigs and
fowls, and the old gray donkey on the green, with
whom she has formed quite a friendship. She feeds
him with bread-and-milk every morning, foolish child!’</p>

<p>She said this with the mother’s tender look at
the fair-haired damsel, who disposed of the bread-and-honey
as fast as if she had laid a wager with
Geoffrey as to which of them should devour most.</p>

<p>‘And have you been happy here?’ asked
Geoffrey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>‘Yes—after the first bitter pain of seeing my
lost home, and remembering how I lost it. I have
been happier than I had hoped ever to be again.
After all, there is some magic in one’s native
air.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ exclaimed Geoffrey, with an air of conviction,
‘of course there is. I have a place in Hampshire
myself, not a stone’s-throw, in a rural point
of view—that is to say, five-and-twenty miles or so—from
here. No end of arable and meadow-land,
and copse and rabbit-warren, and some well-wooded
ground about the house, which my father took the
liberty to call a park; and a nice old house enough,
of the Queen-Anne period; stiffish and squarish and
reddish, but by no means a bad kind of barrack.
I’ll give the sugar-broker notice—no, I can’t do that—I’ll
offer to buy back his lease to-morrow.’</p>

<p>‘The sugar-broker!’ repeated Janet, perplexed.</p>

<p>‘Yes, a fellow I was foolish enough to let my
place to when I came of age—seven, fourteen, or
twenty-one years. He’s keeping it up uncommonly
well, I’m told; has put up a good deal of glass in
the kitchen-garden, and so on, and improved the
farm-buildings. But he shall go. He’s on for his
fourteen years; so I can’t give him notice to quit,
but I can offer him a tempting price for the lease.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
I daresay he’s tired of the place by this time. People
always do get tired of their places.’</p>

<p>‘But what can you want with a great place like
that?’ asked Janet.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know. Didn’t you say you were fond of
this part of the country?’ asked Geoffrey, in some
confusion. Those cups of orange pekoe had proved far
more intoxicating than the vintages of Rhineland.</p>

<p>‘O, Mr. Hossack, pray do not let <em>my</em> fancies influence
your life!’ said Janet earnestly. ‘Remember
we may never be more to each other than we are
now,—very good friends, who may meet once in a
way, at some chance turn in life’s road.’</p>

<p>Geoffrey pleaded his hardest, but felt that he was
pleading in vain. All arguments were futile. Honour
counselled Janet to be firm, and she was steadfast as
a rock.</p>

<p>‘I will not tell you that you are indifferent to
me,’ she said, in her low sweet voice, unembarrassed
by the presence of the child, who was absorbed in
the antics of her kitten, and troubled herself in no
manner about what Mr. Hossack might be saying
to her mother, and presently, having eaten to repletion,
roamed out into the garden among the clove-carnations
and late roses and tall gaudy hollyhocks.
‘That would be too ungrateful, after all the trouble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
you have taken for my sake. I can only say that,
until I have proof positive of my first husband’s
death, I shall continue to consider myself bound to
him.’</p>

<p>‘But what stronger proof can you hope for than
my assurance of the fact? Remember that Mr. Vandeleur
perished in a solitude where there are no registrars
to take note of a man’s death, no coroner to
hold an inquest on his body, no undertakers to give
him decent burial; where a rough-and-ready grave
under the pine-trees would be the sole witness of
his end.’</p>

<p>‘We will trust in Providence, Mr. Hossack,’
answered Janet, with that steadfast look he knew so
well, and which made her seem a creature so far
above him—a being exempt from common temptations
and human passions. ‘If my husband died as
you tell me he died, I do not doubt that in due time
there will arise some confirmation of your story.’</p>

<p>Geoffrey sighed, and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>‘If the pine-trees or the songless birds of
the wilderness could talk, you might receive such
confirmation,’ he said; ‘but from any other source
it is impossible.’</p>

<p>‘Why, my brother was with you all the time,
was he not?’ inquired Janet, with a wondering look.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
‘He at least must be able to vouch for the truth of
your story.’</p>

<p>Geoffrey grew deadly pale, and for a few moments
was speechless.</p>

<p>‘Unhappily,’ he faltered, after that awkward
pause, ‘Lucius had a bad attack—brain fever, or
apoplexy he called it—just at the time of this man’s
death. His evidence would therefore hardly satisfy
you.’</p>

<p>‘In point of fact, Mr. Hossack, it seems that
neither you nor my brother were in a condition to
know anything about the event. You could have
only hearsay evidence. Who was your informant?’</p>

<p>This question was a home-thrust. To name
Lucius would have been almost to betray him; and
again, he had just given her to understand that
Lucius was unconscious at the time of the event.
Again there came a pause, painfully awkward for
Geoffrey. He felt that Mrs. Bertram was watching
him with gravely questioning eyes. How was he to
reply?</p>

<p>‘There was a little German with us,’ he said
at last, with a desperate plunge, knowing not how
near to his friend’s betrayal this admission might
lead him; ‘a sea-captain, a native of Hamburg,
called Schanck—Absalom Schanck—a very good fellow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
who was with us—our fellow-traveller. I—I
think you must have heard me speak of him. He
saw the shot fired.’</p>

<p>‘And saw my husband die?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ answered Geoffrey, but not with perfect
conviction; ‘I believe so.’</p>

<p>‘And pray, where is Mr. Schanck? His evidence
may be worth very little, but it would be as well to
hear it.’</p>

<p>‘Upon my word,’ said Geoffrey, crestfallen, ‘I’m
afraid that at this present moment Schanck is washing
gold in San Francisco, unless he has been made
mincemeat of by larger diggers.’</p>

<p>‘We must wait for some other witness then,’
said Janet, in a tone of calm certainty, which made
reply seem impossible.</p>

<p>Geoffrey could but submit. He must needs obey
this lovely image of destiny.</p>

<p>‘So be it,’ he said, with a despairing sigh; ‘but
you will let me come to see you sometimes—won’t
you, Janet?’ very tenderly, and evidently expecting a
reproof; instead of which his devotion was rewarded
with a smile. ‘And you’ll receive me just as you
have done this afternoon, and give me a cup of that
delicious Pekoe?’</p>

<p>‘A cup!’ exclaimed Janet; ‘I think you had five.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>‘I may come to tea again, mayn’t I, once in
three weeks or so, like a boy who has a Saturday
afternoon at home? Flossie likes me, you see,’ pleaded
he jesuitically.</p>

<p>‘Well, you may come once a month, or so, if you
happen to be in the neighbourhood.’</p>

<p>‘Happen to be in the neighbourhood! I would
cross the Balkan range in January to obtain such a
privilege.’</p>

<p>‘But remember you come only as my friend. If
you talk to me as you have talked this afternoon, I
shall ring for Sally, and tell her to show you to the
door. It would be only a formula—as the street-door
opens out of this room—but I should do it nevertheless.’</p>

<p>‘There shall not be one word that can offend you.’</p>

<p>‘On that condition you may come; but, believe
me, your own happiness would be better secured by
your utter forgetfulness of a woman who may never
be free to reward your fidelity. There are so many
who would be proud of such a lover. Amongst them
you might surely find one who would realise your
ideal as well as, if not better than, I.’</p>

<p>‘Never!’ protested Geoffrey, with warmth. ‘I
never knew what a great love was till I knew you.
I will never open my heart to a lesser love.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>Janet gave a little sigh, half regret, half satisfaction.
After all, a woman does not easily relinquish
such devotion. She has a duty to fulfil, and her
little lecture, her few words of wise counsel, to pronounce;
and having done that duty, she is hardly
sorry if her foolish adorer refuses to hear.</p>

<p>So they parted—not briefly, for little Flossie hung
about Geoffrey, and impeded his departure; nay, at
his and Flossie’s joint request, Janet walked half the
length of the lane with Geoffrey and the child. They
only parted within sight of the distant towers of
Mardenholme.</p>

<p>‘How pleased Lady Baker would be if she knew
you were so near!’ said Geoffrey.</p>

<p>‘Pray, don’t tell her. She was very good to me,
and I was fond of her; but she would want me to
go to that great house of hers, full of strange faces,
and sing to her company, and be made a show of.
I have contrived to keep very clear of her pathway so
far, near as I am. Pray, do not betray me.’</p>

<p>‘To hear is to obey. But you really do mean to
stay here?’ inquired Geoffrey anxiously. ‘When I
come a month hence to claim that cup of Pekoe, I
sha’n’t find you fled, eh?’</p>

<p>‘I promise that if anything should induce me to
leave Foxley—that’s the name of our little village—I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
will write you a line to say where I am going.
But my present intention is to stay here till November—just
long enough for a thorough rest—and then
go back to my pupils at Stillmington.’</p>

<p>Geoffrey sighed. The thought of those sol-fa
classes, and the hard labour they involved, always
smote him to the quick; and he was rioting in the
Three per cents, as he told himself.</p>

<p>He took his time in returning to Mardenholme;
and the tableaux vivants had begun when he pushed
his way in among the crowd of young men standing
at the back of the picture-gallery, Lady Baker having
naturally invited a good many more guests than
could find even standing room. Here he stood patiently
enough, and saw as much of the living pictures
after Frith, Faed, and Millais as he could conveniently
behold above the heads of the crowd in
front of him. He was not deeply interested in the
performance, his mind indeed being rather occupied
with tender recollections of the humble tea-party at
which he had lately assisted than by the charms of the
graceful young lady who danced with Claude Duval,
or of the pretty peasant lassie, with her shepherd’s
plaid and neatly-snooded hair, or the damsel in white
satin, who took a sad farewell of her Black Brunswicker
under the glare of the lime-light. He applauded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
mechanically when other people applauded,
and felt that he had done all that society could expect
of him. His cousins came out presently among
the crowd, and straightway pounced upon him, and
reproached him with acrimony.</p>

<p>‘Why, Geoffrey, where have you been hiding
yourself?’ asked Belle.</p>

<p>‘I’ve been strolling about the gardens a little,’
replied that arch hypocrite. ‘It’s rather warm in
here.’</p>

<p>‘Rather warm!’ exclaimed Jessie, who was evidently
out of temper. ‘It’s insufferably hot, and
I’m tired to death. These tableaux are a mistake
after a garden-party. Lady Baker always tries to do
too much. One feels so dowdy, too, in morning-dress
when the lamps are lighted. But, pray, how
have you managed to keep out of everybody’s way all
the afternoon, Geoffrey? I haven’t set eyes on you
since luncheon.’</p>

<p>‘I hope you haven’t been looking for me all the
time,’ said Geoffrey, with unruffled coolness. ‘I’ve
been meandering about the grounds, enjoying nature.’</p>

<p>‘Which I thought was not worth looking at in
England,’ remarked Belle. ‘But perhaps, now we
have found you,’ with angry emphasis, ‘you’ll be
kind enough to get us some refreshment. I daresay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
you have had something, but I know I am ready to
sink.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I’ve done pretty well, thanks. I had some
bread-and-honey.’</p>

<p>‘Bread-and-honey!’ cried Jessie.</p>

<p>‘O, that’s to say, something in that way. Your
sweets and kickshaws are all the same to me—I
never know what to call them. Come along, Belle,
we’ll fight our way to the refreshment-room. You
sha’n’t sink if I can help it.’</p>

<p>He piloted the two damsels through the crowd
to a large room, which had been arranged after the
model of a railway refreshment-buffet, save that it
was liberally furnished with things good to eat.
Here Lady Baker’s men and maids dispensed strawberry
ices, tea, coffee, Italian confectionery, German
wines and German salads, to the famishing crowd;
and here Geoffrey, by cramming them with ices,
and creamy vanille-flavoured pastry, contrived to restore
his cousins’ equanimity. There was some talk
of dancing, and a few enthusiastic couples were already
revolving in the drawing-room; but Geoffrey
pleaded that no man could waltz in gray trousers,
and thus escaped the infliction; and having the good
fortune to find his uncle, tired of vestry and quarter-session
talk and inclined to go home, this heartless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
young man had the satisfaction of packing Belle and
Jessie into the landau before Lady Baker’s <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</i> was
half over, as Jessie said discontentedly.</p>

<p>They avenged themselves by abusing the party
all the way home.</p>

<p>‘Those huge garden-parties are detestable!’ exclaimed
Belle. ‘I know Lady Baker only gives
them in order to be civil to a herd of people she
doesn’t care a straw about. She gives nice little
parties for her real friends. I wonder people can be
so slavish as to go to her in droves.’</p>

<p>‘I thought you said Lady Baker’s parties were
delightful,’ said Geoffrey. ‘I know you wrote to me
rapturously about her.’</p>

<p>‘I’m only just beginning to see through her,’
replied Belle, who couldn’t get over the day’s annoyances.
This tiresome Geoffrey had not been the
least good to them. He might just as well have been
in Norway.</p>

<span class="fs70">LUCILLE HAS STRANGE DREAMS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">For</span> a few nights, while Lucille’s fever was at the
worst, Lucius Davoren took up his abode in Cedar
House, and established himself in that little room
adjoining Mr. Sivewright’s bedchamber which had
been lately occupied by Lucille. Here he felt himself
a sure guardian of his patient’s safety. No one
could harm the old man while he, Lucius, was on
the spot to watch by night, and while Mrs. Milderson,
the nurse, in whom he had perfect confidence, was
on guard by day. His own days must needs be fully
occupied out of doors, whatever private cares might
gnaw at his heartstrings; but after introducing the
ex-policeman and his wife, who came to him with a
kind of warranty from Mr. Otranto, and who seemed
honest people, he felt tolerably satisfied as to the
safety of property in the old house, as well as about
that more valuable possession—life. He had locked
the door of the room which contained the chief part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
of Mr. Sivewright’s collection, and carried the key
about with him in his pocket; but there was still a
great deal of very valuable property scattered about
the house, as he knew.</p>

<p>One thing troubled him, and that was the existence
of the secret staircase, communicating in some
manner—which he had been up to this point unable
to discover—with Mr. Sivewright’s bedroom. He
had sounded Homer Sivewright cautiously upon this
subject, and the old man’s answers had led him to
believe that he, so long a tenant of the house, knew
absolutely nothing of the hidden staircase; or it might
be only an exaggerated caution and a strange passion
for secrecy which sealed Homer Sivewright’s lips.</p>

<p>Once, when his patient was asleep, Lucius contrived
to examine the panelling in front of the
masked staircase, but he could discover no means of
communication. If there were, as he fully believed,
a sliding panel, the trick of it altogether baffled him.
This failure worried him exceedingly. He had a
morbid horror of that possible entrance to his patient’s
room, which it was beyond his power to defend
by bolt, lock, or bar, since he knew not the
manner of its working. For worlds he would not
have alarmed Mr. Sivewright, who was still weak as
an infant, although wonderfully improved during the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
last few days. He was therefore compelled to be
silent, but he felt that here was the one hitch in his
scheme of defence from the hidden enemy.</p>

<p>‘After all, there is little need to torment myself
about the mystery,’ he thought sometimes. ‘It is
clear enough that these Winchers were guilty alike
of the robbery and the attempt to murder. The
greater crime was but a means of saving themselves
from the consequences of the lesser; or they may
possibly have supposed that their old master had
left them well provided for in his will, and that the
way to independence lay across his grave. It is hard
to think that human nature can be so vile, but in
this case there is scarcely room for doubt.’</p>

<p>He thought of that man whom he had seen in
the brief glare of the frequent lightning—the man
who had raised himself from his crouching attitude
to look up at the lighted window on the topmost
story, and had then scaled the wall.</p>

<p>‘The receiver of stolen goods, the medium by
which they disposed of their booty, no doubt,’ he
said to himself; ‘their crime would have been incomplete
without such aid.’</p>

<p>Although all his endeavours to find the key belonging
to the door of the staircase leading to the
upper story had failed, Lucius had not allowed himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
to be baffled in his determination to explore
those unoccupied rooms. Now that Lucille’s prostration
and the Winchers’ dismissal had made him
in a manner master of the house, he sent for a blacksmith
and had the lock picked, and then went up-stairs
to explore, accompanied by the man, whom he
ordered to open the doors of the rooms as he had
opened the door of the staircase. There was little
to reward his perseverance in those desolate attic
chambers. Most of them were empty; but in one—that
room whose door he had seen stealthily opened
and stealthily closed on his previous visit to those
upper regions—he found some traces of occupation.
Two or three articles of battered old furniture—an old
stump bedstead of clumsy make, provided with bedding
and blankets, which lay huddled upon it as if
just as its last occupant had left it—the ashes of a
fire in the narrow grate—a table, with an old ink-bottle,
a couple of pens, and a sheet of ink-stained
blotting-paper—an empty bottle smelling of brandy
on the mantelpiece, a bottle which, from its powerful
odour, could hardly have been emptied very long ago—a
tallow-candle, sorely gnawed by rats or mice, in
an old metal candlestick on the window-seat—a scrap
of carpet spread before the hearth, a dilapidated arm-chair
drawn up close to it: a room which, to Lucius<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
Davoren’s eye, looked as if it had been the lair of
some unclean creature—one of those lost wretches
in whom the fashion of humanity has sunk to its
lowest and vilest phase.</p>

<p>He looked round the room with a shudder.</p>

<p>‘There has been some one living here lately,’
he said, thinking aloud.</p>

<p>‘Ay, sir,’ answered the blacksmith, ‘it looks like
it; some one who wasn’t over particklar about his
quarters, I should think, by the look of the place.
But he seems to have had summat to comfort him,’
added the man, with mild jocosity, pointing to the
empty bottle on the chimneypiece.</p>

<p>Some one had occupied that room; but who was
that occupant? And had Lucille known this fact when
she so persistently denied the evidence of her lover’s
senses—when she had shown herself so palpably
averse to his making any inspection of those rooms?</p>

<p>Who could have been hidden there with her cognisance,
with her approval? About whom could she
have been thus anxious? For a moment the question
confounded him. He could only wonder, in blank
dull amazement.</p>

<p>Then, in the next moment, the lover’s firm faith
arose in rebuke of that brief suspicion.</p>

<p>‘What, am I going to doubt her again,’ he said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
to himself, ‘while she lies ill and helpless, with utmost
need of my affection? Of course she was utterly
ignorant of the fact that yonder room was occupied,
and therefore ridiculed my statement about the open
door. Was it strange if her manner seemed flurried or
nervous, when she had just been startled by the sight
of her father’s portrait? I am a wretch to doubt her,
even for a moment.’</p>

<p>He went up to the loft, and thoroughly examined
that dusty receptacle, but found no living creature
there except the spiders, whose webs festooned the
massive timbers that sustained the ponderous tiled
roof. This upper portion of the house was vacant
enough now; of that there could be no doubt. There
was as little doubt that the room yonder had been
lately occupied. There could but be one solution of
the mystery, Lucius decided, after some anxious
thought. Jacob Wincher had accommodated his accomplice
with a lodging in that room while the two
were planning and carrying out their system of
plunder.</p>

<p>This examination duly made, and the doors fastened
up again in a permanent manner, by the help
of the blacksmith, Lucius felt easier in his mind.
There was still that uncomfortable feeling about the
secret staircase; but with the upper part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
house under lock-and-key, and the lower part carefully
guarded, no great harm could come from the
mere existence of that hidden communication. In
any case, Lucius had done his utmost to make all
things secure. His most absorbing anxiety now was
about Lucille’s illness.</p>

<p>His treatment had been to a considerable extent
successful; the delirium had passed away. The
sweet eyes recognised him once again; the gentle
voice thanked him for his care. But the fever had
been followed by extreme weakness. The sick girl
lay on her bed from day to day, ministered to by
Mrs. Milderson, and had scarcely power to lift her
head from the pillow.</p>

<p>This prostration was rendered all the more painful
by the patient’s feverish anxiety to recover strength.
Again and again, with a piteous air of entreaty, she
asked Lucius when she would be well enough to get
up, to go about the house, to attend to her grandfather.</p>

<p>‘My dearest,’ he answered gravely, ‘we must not
talk about that yet awhile. We have sufficient reason
for thankfulness in the improvement that has
taken place already. We must wait patiently for the
return of strength.’</p>

<p>‘I can’t be patient!’ exclaimed Lucille, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
feeble voice that had changed so much since her
illness. ‘How can I lie here patiently when I know
that I am wanted; that—that everything may be
going on wrong without me?’</p>

<p>‘Was there ever such ingratitude and distrustfulness,’
cried the comfortable old nurse, with pretended
chiding, ‘when she knows I’m that watchful
of the poor old gentleman, and give him all he wants
to the minute; and that when things was at the worst
you slept in the little room next him, Mr. Davoren,
so as to keep guard, as you may say, at night?’</p>

<p>‘Forgive me,’ said Lucille, stretching out her
wasted hand to the nurse, and then to the doctor,
who bent down to press his lips to the poor little
feverish hand. ‘I daresay I seem very ungrateful;
but it isn’t that—I only want to be well. I feel
so helpless lying here; it’s so dreadful to be a prisoner,
bound hand and foot, as it were. Can’t you
get me well quickly somehow, Lucius? Never mind
if I’m ill again by and by; patch me up for a little
while.’</p>

<p>‘Nay, dearest, there shall be no half cure, no
patching. With God’s help, I hope to restore you
to perfect health before very long. But if you are
impatient, if you give way to fretfulness, you will
lessen your chances of a rapid recovery.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>Lucille gave no answer save a long weary sigh.
Tears gathered slowly in her sad eyes, and she
turned her face to the wall.</p>

<p>‘Yes, poor dear,’ said Nurse Milderson, looking
down at her compassionately; ‘as long as she do
fret and werrit herself so, she’ll keep backarding of
her recovery.’</p>

<p>Here the nurse beckoned mysteriously to Lucius,
and led him out of the room into the corridor, where
she unbosomed herself of her cares.</p>

<p>‘It isn’t as I want to alarm you, Dr. Davoren’—Lucius
held brevet rank in the Shadrack-road,—‘far
from it; but I feel myself in duty bound to tell you
that she’s a little wrong in her head still of a night,
between sleeping and waking, as you may say, and
talks and rambles more than I like to hear. And
it’s always “father,” rambling and rambling on
about loving her father, and trusting him in spite of
the world, and standing by him, and suchlike. And
last night—it might have been from half-past one
to two—say a quarter to two, or perhaps twenty
minutes,’ said Mrs. Milderson, with infinite precision,
‘I’d been taking forty winks, as you may say,
in my chair, being a bit worn out, when she turns
every drop of my blood to ice-cold water by crying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
out sudden, in a voice that pierced me to the marrow—’</p>

<p>‘<em>What</em>, nurse? For goodness’ sake, come to the
point,’ cried Lucius, who thought he was never to hear
the end of Mrs. Milderson’s personal sensations.</p>

<p>‘I was coming to it, sir,’ replied that lady, with
offended dignity, ‘when you interrupted me; I was
only anxious to be exack. “O,” she cried out, “not
poison! Don’t say that—no, not poison! You
wouldn’t do that—you wouldn’t be so wicked as to
poison your poor old father.” I think that was
enough to freeze anybody’s blood, sir. But, lor,
they do take such queer fancies when they’re lightheaded.
I’m sure, I nursed a poor dear lady in
Stevedor-lane, in purpleoral fever—which her husband
was in the coal-and-potato line, and ginger-beer
and bloaters, and suchlike—and she used to
fancy her poor head was turned into a york-regent,
and beg and pray of me ever so pitiful to cut the
eyes out of it. I’m proud to say, tho’, as I brought
her round, and there isn’t a healthier-looking woman
between here and the docks.’</p>

<p>Lucius was silent. His own suggestion of a
possible attempt to poison was sufficient to account
for these delirious words of Lucille. It was only
strange that she should have associated her father’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
name with the idea; that in her distempered dream,
he, the father—to whose image she clung with such
fond affection—should have appeared to her in the
character of a parricide.</p>

<p>‘We must try and get back her strength, nurse,’
said Lucius, after a thoughtful pause; ‘with returning
health all these strange fancies will disappear.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir, with returning health!’ sighed Mrs.
Milderson, whose cheerfulness seemed somewhat to
have deserted her.</p>

<p>This sick-nursing was, as she was wont to remark,
much more trying than attendance upon
matrons and their new-borns. It lacked the lively
element afforded by the baby. ‘I feel lonesome
and down-hearted-like in a sick-room,’ Mrs. Milderson
would remark to her gossips, ‘and the
cryingest, peevishest baby that ever was would be a
blessing to me after a fever case.’</p>

<p>‘You don’t think her worse, do you?’ asked
Lucius, alarmed by that sigh.</p>

<p>‘No, sir; but I don’t think her no better,’ answered
Mrs. Milderson, with the vagueness of an
oracle. ‘She’s that low, there’s no cheering of her
up. I’m sure, I’ve sat and told her about some of
my reglar patients—Mrs. Binks in the West Inja-road,
and Mrs. Turvitt down by the Basin—and done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
all I could think of to enliven her, but she always
gives the same impatient sigh, and says, “I do so
long to get well, nurse.” She must have been very
low, Dr. Davoren, before she took to her bed.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Lucius, remembering that sudden
fainting-fit. ‘She had allowed herself too little rest
in her attendance upon her grandfather.’</p>

<p>‘She must have worn herself to a shadder, poor
dear young creature,’ said Mrs. Milderson. ‘But
don’t you be uneasy, sir,’ pursued the matron, having
done her best to make him so; ‘if care and constant
watchfulness can bring her round, round she
shall be brought.’</p>

<p>Thus Lucius Davoren went about his daily work
henceforward with a new burden on his mind—the
burden of care for that dear patient, for whom, perchance,
his uttermost care might be vain.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE DAWN OF HOPE</span>.</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> glory of the summer had departed from the
Shadrack-road. The costermongers no longer bawled
their fine fresh ‘Arline’ plums, their ‘gages’ at four-pence
per quart; cucumbers had grown too yellow
and seedy even for the Shadrackites; green apples
were exhibited on the stalls and barrows; the cracking
of walnuts was heard at every street-corner; and
the great bloater season—which was a kind of minor
saturnalia in this district—had been inaugurated by
the first triumphal cry of ‘Rale Yarmouths, two for
threehalfpence!’ The pork-butchers, whose trade had
somewhat slackened during the dog-days—though
the Shadrackites were always pork-eaters—now began
to find demand growing brisker. In a word, autumn
was at hand. Not by wide plains of ripening corn,
or the swift flight of the scared covey rising from
their nest in the long grass, did the Shadrackites
perceive the change of seasons, but by the contents
of the costermongers’ barrows. At this time, also,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
that raven cry of cholera—generally arising out of
the sufferings of those unwary citizens who had indulged
too freely in such luxuries as conger-eel and
cucumber—dwindled and died away; and the Shadrackites,
moved by that gloomy spirit which always beheld
clouds upon the horizon, prophesied that the
harvest would be a bad one, and bread dear in the
coming winter.</p>

<p>Lucius went among them day after day, and
ministered to them, and was patient with them, and
smiled at the little children, and talked cheerily to
the old people, despite that growing anxiety in his
own breast. He neglected not a single duty, and
spent no more of his day in Cedar House than he
had done before he took up his quarters there. He
ate his frugal meals in his own house, and only went
to Mr. Sivewright’s dreary old mansion at a late
hour in the evening. He had carried some of his medical
books there, and often sat in his little bedroom
reading, long after midnight. His boy had
orders to run on to Cedar House should there be any
call for his aid in the dead hours of the night.</p>

<p>He brooded much over that small packet of letters
which he counted among his richest treasures—those
letters from the man who signed himself ‘H. G.,’ and
the lady whom he wrote of as Madame Dumarques,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
the lady whose own delicate signature appeared in
clearest characters upon the smooth foreign paper—written
with ink that had paled with the lapse of
years—Félicie.</p>

<p>Lucius read these letters again and again; and
the result of this repeated perusal was the conviction
that the writers of those lines were the parents
of Lucille. Why should they have been thus deeply
interested in Ferdinand Sivewright’s child, or how
should he have been able to put forward a claim for
money on that child’s behalf?</p>

<p>Lucius had taken these letters into his custody
with the determination to turn them to good account.
If it were within the limits of possibility, he would
discover the secret to which these letters afforded so
slight a clue. That was the resolve he had made
when he took the packet from Homer Sivewright’s
desk—and time in nowise diminished the force of
his intention. But he had no heart to begin his
search just yet, while Lucille was dangerously ill.</p>

<p>In the mean time he thought the matter over,
repeatedly deliberating as to the best means of
beginning a task which promised to be difficult.
Should he consult Mr. Otranto—should he commit
his chances to the wisdom and experience of that
famous private detective?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>His own answer to his own question was a decided
negative. ‘No,’ he said to himself, ‘I will not
vulgarise the woman I love by giving the broken
links of the story of her birth to a professional spy,
leaving him to put them together after his own
fashion. If there should be a blot upon her lineage,
his worldly eyes shall not be the first to discover
the stain. Heaven has given me brains which are
perhaps as good as Mr. Otranto’s; and constancy of
purpose shall stand me in the stead of experience.
I will do this thing myself. Directly Lucille is in
a fair way to recovery, I will begin my task; and it
shall go hard with me if I do not succeed.’</p>

<p>The days passed slowly enough for the parish doctor’s
hard-worked brain, which felt weary of all
things on earth, or of all those things which
made up the sum of his monotonous life. September
had begun, and a slight improvement had
arisen in Lucille’s condition. She was a little
stronger, a little more cheerful—had rewarded her
doctor’s care with just a faint shadow of her once-familiar
smile. She had been lifted out of her bed
too one warm afternoon, and wrapped in her dressing-gown
and an old faded Indian shawl that had
belonged to Homer Sivewright’s Spanish wife, and
placed in an easy-chair by the open window to drink<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
tea with Mrs. Milderson. Whereupon there had been
a grand tea-drinking, to which Lucius was admitted,
and in which there was some touch of the happiness
of bygone days.</p>

<p>‘Do you remember the first time you gave me a
cup of tea, Lucille,’ said Lucius, ‘that winter’s night,
in the parlour down-stairs?’</p>

<p>The girl’s eyes filled with sudden tears, and she
turned her head aside upon the pillow that supported
it.</p>

<p>‘I was so happy then, Lucius,’ she said; ‘now
I am full of cares.’</p>

<p>‘Needless cares, believe me, dearest,’ answered
her lover. ‘Your grandfather is a great deal better—weak
still, but much stronger than you are. He
will be down-stairs first, depend upon it. I should
have brought him in to take tea with us this afternoon
if I had not been afraid of agitating you. I
never had such a nervous excitable patient.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, you may well say that, Dr. Davoren,’ said
Nurse Milderson, with her good-natured scolding tone.
‘I never see such an eggsitable patient—toss and
turn, and worrit her poor dear self, as if she had all
the cares of this mortial world upon her blessed
shoulders. Why, Mrs. Beck, in Stevedor-square,
that has seven children and a chandler’s business to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
look after, doesn’t worrit half as much when she
keeps her bed, tho’ she knows as everythink is at
sixes and sevens down-stairs; those blessed children
tumbling down and hurting of themselves at every
hand’s turn—and a bit of a girl serving in the shop
that don’t know where to lay her hand upon a thing,
and hasn’t headpiece to know the difference between
best fresh and thirteen-penny Dorset.’</p>

<p>Altogether this tea-drinking had been a happy
break in Lucius Davoren’s life, despite those tears of
Lucille. He had been with her once more; it had
seemed something like old times. He saw a great
peril past, and was thankful. After tea he read to
her a little—some mild tender lines of Wordsworth’s—and
then they sat talking in the dusk.</p>

<p>Many times during her illness Lucille had embarrassed
her lover by her anxious inquiries about
the Winchers. He had hitherto waived the question;
now he told her briefly that they were gone—Mr.
Sivewright had dismissed them.</p>

<p>She protested against this as a great cruelty.</p>

<p>‘They were devoted to my grandfather; they were
the best and most faithful servants that ever any
one had,’ she said.</p>

<p>‘They might seem so, Lucille, and yet be capable
of robbing their old master on the first good opportunity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
Your grandfather’s long illness afforded
them that opportunity, and I believe they took it.’</p>

<p>‘How can you know that? Was anything stolen?’
she asked eagerly.</p>

<p>‘Yes; some valuable pieces of old silver, and
other property, were taken.’</p>

<p>A look of intense pain came into the pale care-worn
face.</p>

<p>‘How can you be sure those things were taken
by the Winchers?’ she asked.</p>

<p>‘Simply because there is no one else who could
possibly get at them. Jacob Wincher showed himself
very clever throughout the business, acted a little
comedy for my edification, and evidently thought to
hoodwink me. But I was able to see through him.
In point of fact, the evidence against him was conclusive.
So at my advice your grandfather dismissed
him, without an hour’s warning; and strange to say,
his health has been slowly mending ever since his
faithful servant’s departure.’</p>

<p>‘What!’ cried Lucille, with a horrified look,
‘you think it possible that Wincher can have—’</p>

<p>‘Tampered with the medicine by your grandfather’s
bedside. Yes, Lucille, that is what I do
believe; but he is now safe on the outside of this
house, and you need not give yourself a moment’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
uneasiness upon the subject. Think of it as something
that has never been, and trust in my care for
the security of the future. No evil-disposed person
shall enter this house while I am here to guard it.’</p>

<p>The girl looked at him with a wild despairing
gaze—looked at him without seeing him—looked
beyond him, as if in empty space her eyes beheld
some hideous vision. She flung her head aside upon
the pillow, with a gesture of supreme dejection.</p>

<p>‘A thief and a murderer!’ she said in tones too
low to reach the lover’s ear. ‘O, my dream, my
dream!’</p>

<span class="fs70">AN OLD FRIEND REAPPEARS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Lucius</span> had been working a little harder than usual
on one of those September afternoons, and was just
a shade more weary of Shadrack-Basin and its surroundings
than his wont. He looked at the forest
of spars visible yonder above the housetops, and
wished that he and Lucille could have sailed together
in one of those great ships, far out into the wild wide
main, to seek some new-made world, where care was
not, only love and hope. He had often envied the
stalwart young Irishmen, the healthy apple-cheeked
girls, the strong hearty wayfarers from north and
south and east and west, whom he had seen depart,
happy and hopeful, from possible penury here to
follow fortune to the other side of the globe, in some
monster emigrant-ship, which sailed gaily down the
river with her cargo of human life. To-day he had
felt more than usually oppressed by the fetid atmosphere
of narrow alleys, the dirt-poison which pervaded
those scenes in which he had been called to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
minister—human dens, many of them, which only he
and the pale-faced High-Church curate of St. Winifred’s,
Shadrack-road, ever penetrated, excepting always
the landlord’s agent, who came as regular as
Monday morning itself, with his book and his little
ink-bottle in his waistcoat-pocket, ready to make his
entry of the money which so very often was <em>not</em> to
hand. He gave a great sigh of relief as he came out
of the last of the narrow ways to which duty had
called him; a lane of tall old houses, in which one
hardly saw the sky, and where smallpox had lately
appeared—a more hateful visitor than even the agent
with his ink-bottle.</p>

<p>‘I must get the taint of that place blown out of
me somehow before I go to <em>her</em>,’ thought Lucius.
‘I’ll take a walk down by the docks, and get what
air is to be had from the river.’</p>

<p>Air in those narrow streets there was none; life
in a diving-bell could hardly have been much worse.
The fresh breeze from the water seemed more invigorating
than strong wine. Lucius got all he could
of it—which was not very much—so completely was
the shore occupied by tall warehouses, stores, provision-wharfs,
and so on.</p>

<p>He walked as far as St. Katharine’s Wharf, always
hugging the river; and here, having some time to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
spare before his usual hour for presenting himself
at Cedar House, he folded his arms and took his
ease, lazily watching the bustle of the scene around
him.</p>

<p>He had been here before many times in his rare
intervals of leisure—the brief pauses in his long
day’s work—and had watched the departing steamers
with a keen envy of the travellers they carried—a
longing for quiet old German cities—for long tranquil
summer days dawdled away in the churches and
picture-galleries of quaint old Belgian towns—for
idle wanderings in Brittany’s sleepy villages, by
the sunlit Rance,—for anything, in short, rather
than the dusty beaten track of his own dull life. Of
course this was before he knew Lucille; all his aspirations
nowadays included her.</p>

<p>On this bright sunny afternoon, a west wind blowing
freshly down the river, he lounged with folded
arms, and watched the busy life of that silent highway
with a sense of supreme relief at having ended
his day’s work. The wharf itself was quiet enough at
this time. A few porters loitered about; one or two
idlers seemed on the look-out, like Lucius, for nothing
in particular. He heard the porters say something
about the Polestar, from Hamburg—heard
without heeding, for his gaze had wandered after a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
mighty vessel—an emigrant-ship, he felt assured—which
had just emerged from the docks, and was
being towed down the broadening river by a diminutive
black tug, which made no more of the business
than if that floating village had been a cockle-shell.
He was still watching this outward-bound vessel,
when a loud puffing and panting and snorting arose
just below him. A bell rang: the porters seemed
to go suddenly mad; a lot of people congregated
from nowhere in particular, and the wharf was all
life and motion, frantic hurry and eagerness.</p>

<p>The Polestar steamer had just arrived from Hamburg,
three hours after her time, as he heard the
porters tell each other. Lucius looked down at that
vessel, with her cargo of commonplace humanity—looked
listlessly, indifferently—while the passengers
came scrambling, up the gangway, all more or less
dilapidated by the sea voyage.</p>

<p>But presently Lucius gave a great start. Just
beneath him, among those newly disembarked voyagers,
he beheld a little fat man, with a round comfortable
florid face, close shaven—a supremely calm
individual, amidst all that turmoil and hurry, carrying
a neat little shiny portmanteau, and resolutely
refusing all assistance from porters. Lucius had
last seen this man on the shores of the Pacific.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
That round contented Saxon visage belonged to none
other than Absalom Schanck.</p>

<p>The sight of that once-familiar face had a powerful
effect upon Lucius. It brought back the memory
of those dark days in the forest—the vision of the
log-hut—those three quiet figures sitting despondently
by the desolate hearth, where the pine-branches
flared and crackled in the silence—three men who
had no heart for cheerful talk—who had exhausted
every argument by which hope might be sustained.
And still more vividly came back to him the image
of that fourth figure—the haggard face, with its
tangled fringe of unkempt hair, the wild eyes and
tawny skin, the long claw-like hands. Yes, it came
back to him as he had seen it first peering in at the
door of the hut—as he had seen it afterwards in the
lurid glare of the pine-logs—as he had seen it last
of all, distorted with a sudden agony—the death pang—when
those bony hands relaxed their clutch upon
the shattered casement.</p>

<p>Swiftly did these hated memories flash through
his mind. His time for thought was of the briefest,
for the little sea-captain had not far to come before
he must needs pass his old travelling companion.
He looked about him gaily as he mounted, his cheery
countenance and bearing offering a marked contrast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
to the dishevelled and woebegone air of his fellow
passengers. Presently, as his gaze roved here and
there among the crowd, his eyes lighted upon Lucius.
His face became instantly illuminated. He had been
warmly attached to the captain of the small band,
yonder in the West.</p>

<p>‘Thank God,’ thought Lucius, seeing that glad
eager look, ‘at least he doesn’t think of me as a
murderer. The sight of me inspires no horror in
his mind.’</p>

<p>‘Yase,’ said the sea-captain, holding out his
plump little hand; ‘there is no misdakes—it is my
froint Daforen.’</p>

<p>He and his ‘froint Daforen’ grasped hands heartily,
and suffered themselves to be pushed against the
wooden railing of the wharf, while the crowd surged
by them.</p>

<p>‘I thought you were in California,’ said Lucius,
after that cordial salutation.</p>

<p>‘Ah, zat is der vay mit von’s froinds. Man goes
to a place, and zey tink he is pound to sday there for
the ewigkeit. He is gone, zey say, as if he had the
bower of logomotion ferlost. Man dalks of him as if
he vas dead. Yase, I have to Galifornia gebeen. I have
diggit, and golt not gefounden, and have come to England
zuruck; and have gone to Hampurg to see my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
families; and have found my families for the mosten
dead, and am come back to my guddy at Pattersea,
vhere my little housegeeper geep all things sdraight
vhile I am avay. If I am in the Rocky Moundains,
if I am in Galifornia, it is nichts. She geep my
place didy. She haf my case-bottle and my bipe
bereit vhen I go home. And now, Daforen, come to
Pattersea one time, and let us have one long talk.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ answered Lucius thoughtfully. ‘I want
a long talk with you, my dear old Schanck. The
time when we parted company seems to me something
like a dream. I can just remember our parting.
But when I look back to those days I see them
through a mist—like the dim outline of the hills in
the cloudy autumn daybreak. Our journey through the
forest with those Canadians—our arrival at New Westminster.
I know that such things were, but I feel as if
they must have happened to some one else, and not to
me. Yet all that went <em>before</em> that time is clear enough,
God knows. I shall never lose the memory of <em>that</em>.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, you was fery ill—you valked in your head,
for long time. If I hat not mate one little hole in
your arm, and let the blood spurten, like one fountain,
you might have shall died becomen been,’ said
the German, somewhat vague in his grasp of
English compound tenses, which he was apt to prolong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
indefinitely, ‘Yes, you valk in your talk—vat
it is you say? ramblen. But come now, shall ve dake
a gab—it is long vays to Pattersea—or vait for a
steamer at Dowers Varf.’</p>

<p>‘The steamer will be quicker, perhaps,’ said
Lucius, ‘and we can talk on board her. There are
some questions I want to ask you, Schanck. I shall
have to touch upon a hateful subject; but there are
some points on which I want to be satisfied.’</p>

<p>‘You shall ask all questions das you vish.
Come quick to Dowers Varf.’</p>

<p>‘Stay,’ said Lucius, ‘I am expected somewhere
this evening, and the Battersea voyage will take some
time. You want to get home at once, I suppose, old
fellow?’</p>

<p>‘That want I much. There is the little housewife.
I want that she has not run away to see.’</p>

<p>‘Run away to sea,’ cried Lucius, puzzled. ‘Has
she any proclivity of that kind?’</p>

<p>‘I want to see she not has run away. Where is
it you English put your verb?’</p>

<p>‘Well, just let me send a message, Salom’—Salom
was short for Absalom, a pet name bestowed on
the little German in the brighter days of their expedition—‘and
I’m at your service.’</p>

<p>Lucius scrawled a few lines in pencil on a leaf of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
his pocket-book, which he tore out and folded into a
little note. This small missive he addressed to Miss
Sivewright, Cedar House, and intrusted to a porter,
whose general integrity and spotlessness of character
were certified by a metal badge, and who promised to
deliver the note for the modest sum of sixpence.</p>

<p>The note was only to inform Lucille that Lucius
had an unexpected engagement for that evening,
and could not be at Cedar House till late. It
had become a custom for him to drink tea in the sick
room, with Lucille, and Mrs. Milderson, who was
overflowing with sympathy.</p>

<p>This small duty accomplished, Lucius accompanied
Mr. Schanck to Tower Wharf, where they
speedily embarked on a steamer bound for the Temple
Pier, where they could transfer themselves to another
bark which plied between that pier and Chelsea.</p>

<p>The boat was in no wise crowded, yet Lucius felt
it was no place for confidential talk. Who could say
what minion of Mr. Otranto’s might be lurking
among those seedily-clad passengers, most of whom
had a nondescript vagabond look, as if they had
neither trade nor profession, and had no motive for
being on board that boat save a vague desire to get
rid of time?</p>

<p>Influenced by this insecurity Lucius spoke only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
of indifferent subjects, till, after stopping at innumerable
piers, and lowering their chimney beneath innumerable
bridges, as it seemed to Lucius, they came
at last to Cadogan Pier, whence it was an easy walk
across Battersea-bridge to the sea-captain’s domicile.</p>

<p>This bit of the river-side has an old-world look, or
had a few years ago—a look that reminded Mr.
Schanck pleasantly of little waterside towns on the
shores of the mighty Elbe. The wooden backs of
the dilapidated old houses overhung the water; the
tower of Chelsea Church rose above the flat; there
were a few trees, an old bridge; a generally picturesque
effect produced out of the humblest materials.</p>

<p>‘It buts me in mint of my faterlant,’ said Absalom,
as they paused on the bridge to look back at
the Chelsea shore.</p>

<p>Mr. Schanck’s abode was small and low—on a
level with the river; whereby at spring-tide the
housewife’s kitchen was apt to be flooded. A flagstaff
adorned the little square of garden, which was
not floral, its chief decorations being a row of
large conk shells, and two ancient figure-heads,
which stood on either side of the small street-door,
glaring at the visitor, painted a dead white, and
ghastly as the spectres of departed vessels.</p>

<p>One was a gigantic Loreley, with flowing hair;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
the other was Frederick the Great; and these were
the tutelary gods of Mr. Schanck’s home.</p>

<p>Within, the visitor descended a step or two—the
steps steep and brassbound, like a companion-ladder—to
the small low-ceiled sitting-room which Mr.
Schanck called his cuddy. Here he was provided
with numerous cupboards with sliding-doors—in fact,
the walls were all cupboard—in which were to be
found all a ship’s stores on a small scale, from
mathematical instruments and case-bottles to tinned
provisions and grocery. From these stores Mr.
Schanck dealt out the daily rations to his housewife,
a little woman of forty-five or so, whose husband
had been his first mate, and had died in his service.
There was a small cellar, approached by a trap-door,
below this parlour or cuddy, where there were more
tinned provisions, groceries, ship-biscuit, and case-bottles,
and which Mr. Schanck called the lazarette.
The galley, or kitchen, was on the other side of a
narrow passage, and a stair of the companion-ladder
fashion—steep and winding—led to three small staterooms
or bedchambers, one of which was furnished
with the hammock wherein Mr. Schanck had slept
away so many unconscious hours, rocked in the
cradle of the deep.</p>

<p>Above these rooms was the well-drained and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
leaded roof, which the proprietor of the mansion
called the poop-deck—the place where, in fine weather,
he loved best to smoke his long pipe and sip his
temperate glass of schiedam-and-water.</p>

<p>He produced a case-bottle and a couple of bright
little glasses from one of the cupboards, gave the
housewife a tin labelled ‘stewed rumpsteak’ out of
another, and bade her prepare a speedy dinner. She
seemed in no wise disturbed or fluttered by his return,
though he had been absent three months, and
had sent no intimation of his coming home.</p>

<p>‘All’s well?’ he said interrogatively.</p>

<p>‘Ay, ay, sir,’ answered the housekeeper. And
thus the question was settled.</p>

<p>‘The ship has leaked a bit now and then, I suppose?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir, there was three feet of water in the
lazarette last spring-tide.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, she is one good ship for all that. Now,
Daforen, you will make yourself zu heim, and we
will have some dinner presently.’</p>

<p>The dinner appeared in a short space of time,
smoking and savoury. Mr. Schanck, in the mean
while, had laid the cloth with amazing handiness, and
had produced a little loaf of black bread from one of
the cupboards, and a sour-smelling cheese of incredible
hardness; they may both have been there for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
the last three months; and with these <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors d’œuvres</i>
proceeded to take the edge off his appetite. Notwithstanding
which prelude he devoured stewed rumpsteak
ravenously; while Lucius, who was in no humour
to eat, made a feeble pretence of sharing his meal.</p>

<p>Finally, however, Mr. Schanck’s appetite seemed
to be appeased, or he had, at any rate, eaten all there
was to eat, and he dismissed his housekeeper with a
contented air.</p>

<p>‘Let us go up to the poop for our dalk and krok,’
he said; to which Lucius assented. They would
seem more alone there than in close proximity to
that busy little housewife, who was washing plates
and dishes within earshot.</p>

<p>They ascended the companion-ladder, the host
carrying a case-bottle in one hand, and a big brown
water-jug in the other, and seated themselves on a
wide and comfortable bench, which had once adorned
the stern of Mr. Schanck’s honest brig. There was a
neat little table for the case-bottle and jug, the glasses
and pipes.</p>

<p>‘This is what I gall gomfortable,’ said Mr.
Schanck, who got more English in his mode of expression,
as he talked with Lucius, and forgot his
‘families’ in Hamburg, with whom he had lately
held converse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>The sun was setting behind the western flats out
Fulham way; the tide was low; the crimson orb reflected
on the bosom of the shining mud, with an
almost Turneresque effect.</p>

<p>‘It was to live at Chelsea that made your Turner
one great painter,’ said Mr. Schanck, with conviction.
‘Where else out of Holland could he see such landscapes?’</p>

<p>They began to talk presently of those old days in
America, but Lucius shrank with a strange dread
from that one subject which he was most anxious to
speak about. There was one faintest shadow of a
doubt which a few words from Absalom Schanck
could dispel. That worthy, in talking over past experiences,
dwelt more on the physical privations they
had undergone—above all, on their empty larder.</p>

<p>‘When I count my tinned provisions—man improves
daily in the art of tinned provisions—I can
scarcely believe I was one time so near to starve. I
sometimes feel as if I could never eat enough to
make up for that treatful beriod.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Lucius gloomily, without the faintest
idea of what the other had been saying. ‘I was very
ill yonder, wasn’t I, Schanck, when you bled me?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, and after. Vhen you did rave—ach, mein
Gott, how you did rave!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>‘My brain was on fire when I shot that wretch.
Yet I think, had I been full master of my senses,
which I believe I was not, I should have done just
the same. Tell me, Schanck, you who knew all, and
were my witness in that trying hour, did I commit a
great crime when I killed that man?’</p>

<p>‘I think you gommit no grime at all vhen you
did shoot him, and if you had killed him it vould
have been one very good job.’</p>

<p>‘<em>If</em> I had killed him!’ cried Lucius, starting up.
‘Is there any doubt of his death?’</p>

<p>‘Sit down, Daforen, be dranguil; the man is not
worth that we should be uneasy for him. You asked
if there is any doubt of his death? There is this
much doubt, das when I saw him last he was
alife.’</p>

<p>‘Good God!’ cried Lucius; ‘and I have suffered
an agony of remorse about that man, wretch as I knew
him to be. I have carried the burden of a great sin
on my soul day and night; my dreams have been
haunted, my lonely hours miserable.’</p>

<p>He clasped his hands before his face with a passionate
gesture, and a hoarse sob broke from that
breast, from which a load had been suddenly lifted.
The sense of relief, of thankfulness, was keen as the
keenest pain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>‘Tell me,’ he cried eagerly—‘tell me all about it,
Schanck. Was not that shot fatal? I aimed straight
at his heart.’</p>

<p>‘And you hit him zumvare,’ answered the German,
‘for vhen I vent out and looked apout for him
an hour aftervarts, there were draces of bloot on
the snow; but it couldn’t have been his heart, or he
vould hardly have been able to grawl avay. I followed
him a little vay by that drack of bloot, and the
broken snow through which he had tragged himself
along; but I could not go far; I was anxious about
you, and I went back to the hut. If the man lay dead
in the snow, or if he was shifering under the binedrees,
kroaning with the bain of his vounds, I cared
not.’</p>

<p>‘Was that the last you saw of him,’ asked Lucius—‘those
traces of blood on the snow?’</p>

<p>‘It vas the last for one long time. If you vill be
patient I vill tell you all the story.’</p>

<p>Then, with many peculiarities of expression—desperate
compound substantives, and more desperate
compound tenses of the subjunctive mood, which it
were well to leave unrecorded—the little German
told all he had to tell of that which followed Lucius
Davoren’s fire. How, while Geoffrey slowly mended,
Lucius lay in the torments of fever, brain distracted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
body enfeebled, and life and death at odds which
should be master of that frail temple.</p>

<p>‘You were still very ill when, by God’s mercy,
the Canadian party came our way. Geoffrey met
them in the woods, while he was prowling about with
his gun on the look-out for a moose, or even a martin,
for we were as near starvation as men could be
and not starve. We had kept ourselves alive somehow,
Geoffrey and I, on the pieces of buffalo you
brought home the night before your illness, and when
those were gone, on a tin of arrowroot which Geoffrey
had the luck to find in his travelling bag. When
the Canadians offered to take us on with their party,
you were very feeble, helpless as a little child. Geoffrey
and I looked at each other; it seemed hard to
lose such a chance. They had a spare horse, or at
least a horse only laden with a little baggage—their
provisions having shrunk on the journey—they
offered to put you on this horse, and we accepted the
offer. Geoffrey walked beside you and led the horse;
we made a kind of bed for you on the animal’s back,
and there you lay tied safely to the saddle.’ This
was, in brief, what the sea-captain told him.</p>

<p>‘For Heaven’s sake, come to the other part of your
story, when you saw that man alive,’ cried Lucius;
‘never mind the journey. I have a faint memory—as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
if at best I had been but half conscious—of travelling
on and on, under everlasting pine-trees, of perpetual
snow that dazzled my aching eyes, of pains in
every limb, and a horrible throbbing in my head, and
a parching thirst which was the worst torment of all.
I am not likely to forget that journey.’</p>

<p>‘And you remember how we parted at New Vestminster?
I left you and Geoffrey to gome back to England
your own way, while I went to the golt dickens.
Your dravels had been for bleasure; I had an eye to
pusiness. “Since I can make nothing out of furs,”
I said to myself, “let me see what I can do with
golt. It can require no great genius to dik for golt.”
You puy a spade and pickaxe, and you dik; you get
a bail of vater, and you vash; dat is all.’</p>

<p>‘But the man?’ cried Lucius, in an agony of
impatience. ‘When and where did you see him?’</p>

<p>‘Dear heaven, how impatient he is!’ exclaimed
the little German, puffing stolidly at his pipe, and
without the faintest intention of quickening his accustomed
jog-trot pace. ‘It was long ways off, it
was long times after I wisht you both farewell at New
Vestminster. I leaf you, and go off to San Francisco,
and then to the dickens. Here I find rough
savage men. I have no chance among them; the
life is hart. I am knocked about; I am not strong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
enough for the work. I wish myself—ach, how I
wish myself at home here in my snug little guddy,
or sitting to watch the sun go down on my poop-deck!
I begin to feel what it is to be olt. One day
after I have toiled—all zu nichts—I stretch my veary
limbs to rest unter my wretched shelter. At mitternacht
I hear a lout voice in a tent near at hant—the
voice of a man playing at euchre with other men—a
voice I know. My heart beats fast and lout. “It is that
teufel,” I say to myself, “who eats his fellow-men!”
I grawl out of my tent along the ground, to the tent
from which I hear the sound of that voice—a tent
which had been set up only that night; they are
close together, my own tent and this new one, just a
little space between, in which I am hidden, in the
dark night. I lift the edge of the canvas and look
in. There are men playing cards on the head of a
barrel by the light of a candle. The candle shines
on the face of one man. He is talking, with loud
voice and excited gestures. “If this new claim over
here turns out as well as our claim yonder, mates, a
month longer I shall go back to England,” he says.
“Pack to England,” I say to myself; “you are von
vicked liar; for in the log-hut you tell us you have
never to England been.” I stopped to listen to no
more. Varever your pullet may have hit him—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
it did hit him somevare, for I saw the bloot—there
he vas.’</p>

<p>‘You have mistaken some one else for him,’ said
Lucius, ‘in that doubtful light.’</p>

<p>‘Mistaken! Den I am’mistaken in myself; dis
is not me, but only some von like me. De light vas
not toubtful. I see his face blain as I see yours;
dis eye-vink, dis moment, de teep-set plack eyes—such
eyes, eyes like der teufel’s—and ze little beak
of hair on ze forehead. There was no mistakes. No,
Daforen, es war der mann.’</p>

<p>‘Did you see any more of him?’</p>

<p>‘Nein,’ answered the little man, shaking his
head vehemently; ‘ein mal vas enough. I vent back
to San Francisco next day, and started for England
in the first fessel dat vould confey me. I had had
enough of de dickens.’</p>

<p>‘How long ago was this?’</p>

<p>‘It is von year dass I am returned.’</p>

<p>‘A year!’ repeated Lucius dreamily. ‘And I
did not kill that man after all—grazed his shoulder
perhaps, instead of shooting him through the heart.
The wretch was wriggling in at the window like an
eel when I fired, and care and famine may have made
my hand unsteady. Thank God—ay, with all my
heart and soul—that his blood is not on my head.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
He deserved to die; but I am glad he did not die by
my hand.’</p>

<p>‘I do not pelieve he vill effer die,’ said Mr.
Schanck. ‘He is a deffil, and has more lifes dan a
cat.’</p>

<p>‘He had made money,’ mused Lucius, ‘and was
coming to England. He is in England at this very
moment perhaps, and may claim his daughter, or
the girl he called his daughter. It is time that I
should solve the mystery of those letters.’</p>

<p>This discovery materially altered the aspect of
things. Ferdinand Sivewright living and in England
meant danger. Would he leave Cedar House unassailed?
Would he fail to discover sooner or later
the fact that it contained valuable property? Would
he not by some means or other endeavour to possess
himself of that property?</p>

<p>He would come back to his old father with pretended
affection, would act the part of the remorseful
prodigal, would cajole Homer Sivewright into forgetfulness
or forgiveness of the past, and thus secure
the inheritance of his father’s treasures.</p>

<p>Then a new idea flashed across Lucius Davoren’s
brain. What if this spirit of evil, this relentless
villain, were at the bottom of the robbery? He remembered
that lithe figure seen so briefly in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
glare of the lightning, just such a form as that of
the gaunt wanderer in the pine-wood. What more
likely than that Ferdinand Sivewright was the thief,
and Wincher only the accomplice? The old servant
might have been bribed to betray his master by
promises of future reward, or by some division of the
plunder in the present.</p>

<p>‘In any case, at the worst, I think I have securely
shut the door upon this villain now and
henceforward,’ thought Lucius.</p>

<p>Yet the idea of Ferdinand Sivewright’s possible
presence in England filled him with a vague anxiety.
It was an infinite relief to feel himself no longer
guilty of this man’s death; but it was a new source
of trouble to know that he was alive. Of all men,
this man was the most to be feared. His presence—were
he indeed the man Lucius had seen enter
Cedar House after midnight—would account for the
poison. That secret staircase might have given
him access to his father’s room. Yet how should
he, a stranger to the house, know of the secret staircase?</p>

<p>Here Lucius was at fault. There was now a new
element in that mystery, which had so far baffled his
penetration.</p>

<p>‘I will see old Wincher, and try to get the truth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
out of him,’ he said to himself. ‘If he is, as I now
suspect, only an accomplice, he may be willing to
inform against his principal.’</p>

<p>After this revelation, so calmly recited by the
worthy Schanck, Lucius was eager to be gone. The
proprietor of the sea-worthy little dwelling, having
said his say, sat placidly contemplating the level Middlesex
shore, now wrapped in the mists of evening.
He could not sympathise with his friend’s feverish
condition.</p>

<p>‘Led us have some subber,’ he remarked presently,
as if in that suggestion there was balm for all
the ills of life. ‘A gurried rappit vould not pe pad,
or a lopster varmed in a zauzeban mit some mateira.’</p>

<p>Even these delicacies offered no temptation to
Lucius.</p>

<p>‘I must get to the City as soon as I can,’ he
said. ‘Good-bye, Schanck. I’ll come and see you
again some day; or you, who are an idle man, might
come to see me. Here’s my card with the address,
ever so far eastward of the wharf where you landed
this afternoon. I thank Providence for our meeting
to-day. It has taken a great load off my mind; but
it has also given me a new source of anxiety.’</p>

<p>This was Greek to Mr. Schanck, who only sighed,
and murmured something about ‘subber,’ and ‘gurried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
rappit,’ strong in his supply of tinned provisions.
Lucius bade him a hearty good-night, and departed
from the calm flats of Battersea, eager to wend his
way back to the Shadrack-road.</p>

<span class="fs70">LUCIUS SEEKS ENLIGHTENMENT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Lucius</span> was more than usually solicitous for the security
of the old house in the Shadrack-road after
his meeting with Absalom Schanck; locks and bolts
were adjusted with an almost mathematical precision
under his eye, or even by his own hand; and Mr.
Magsby, the ex-policeman, remarked to Mrs. Magsby,
in the confidence of the domestic hearth, that for a
young gentleman, Mr. Davoring was the fidgettiest
and worritingest he had ever had dealings with.
Whereupon Mrs. Magsby, who entertained a reverential
admiration for Lucius, protested that she could
see no fidgettiness in taking precautions against
thieves in a house which had already been robbed;
and that burnt children are apt to be timid of fire;
and, in short, that in her opinion, whatever Mr.
Davoren did, he was always ‘the gentleman.’</p>

<p>Early on the day following his visit to Battersea,
Lucius went in quest of Jacob Wincher at the address
which the old servant had given him at departing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Hickett’s, Crown-and-Anchor-alley, was an
abode of modest dimensions, the ground floor being
comprised by a small square parlour with a corner
cut off for the staircase, and an offshoot of an apartment,
with a lean-to roof, in the rear, which served
as a kitchen.</p>

<p>The parlour, into which the street-door opened
directly, was, in the continental sense, Mr. and Mrs.
Wincher’s ‘apartment,’ since it constituted their sole
and entire abode. That convenient fiction, a sofa-bedstead,
with a chintz cover which frequent washing
had reduced to a pale pea-soup colour, occupied
one side of the apartment; a Pembroke table, a chest
of drawers, and three Windsor chairs filled the remaining
space, and left limited standing room for
the inhabitants.</p>

<p>But if the domain was small, it was, in the eyes
of the Crown-and-Anchor world, genteel, if not splendid.
There was a looking-glass in a mahogany frame
over the mantelpiece, with a pair of black-velvet kittens,
and a crockery shepherd and shepherdess in
front of it; a pair of fancy bellows hung from a
nail on one side of the fireplace, and a fancy hearthbrush
adorned the other side. Altogether, Mrs.
Wincher felt that in Mrs. Hickett’s ground floor she
was sumptuously lodged, and could hold her head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
high in the Shadrack-road when, in her own phrase,
she ‘fetched her errands,’ with no galling sense of
having descended the social ladder.</p>

<p>She felt the strength of her position with peculiar
force this morning when she opened the door to
Lucius Davoren.</p>

<p>Her first sensation on beholding him was, as she
informed Mrs. Hickett in a subsequent conversation,
‘astarickle.’ She fully believed he had come to
announce the apprehension of the thief, or the recovery
of the stolen property. But in the next moment
her native dignity came to her rescue, and she
received her guest with a freezing politeness and an
assumption of profound indifference.</p>

<p>Some memory of the summer evenings when
Mrs. Wincher had played the duenna, the happy
talk of a bright future to which she had listened
approvingly, came back to Lucius at sight of her
familiar countenance. He had once thought her the
soul of fidelity; even now he preferred to think her
innocent of any complicity in her husband’s guilt.</p>

<p>Jacob Wincher was sitting by the fireless grate in
a somewhat despondent attitude. He had found
‘odd jobs’ harder to get than he had supposed they
would be, and enforced idleness was uncongenial.
Nor was his slender stock of money calculated to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
hold out long against the charges of rent and
living.</p>

<p>‘Good-morning,’ said Lucius with cold civility.
‘I should be glad to have a few minutes’ talk with
you alone, Mr. Wincher, if you’ll allow me.’</p>

<p>‘I have no secrets from my good lady, sir. You
can say what you have to say before her. You haven’t
found out who took that silver. I can tell as much as
that from your manner,’ said Jacob Wincher quietly.</p>

<p>‘I can’t say that I have actually found the thief,’
answered Lucius; ‘but I have made a discovery which
may help me to find him.’</p>

<p>‘Eh, sir? What discovery?’</p>

<p>‘Mr. Wincher,’ said Lucius, seating himself opposite
the old man and leaning across the table to
look into his face, ‘who was the man you let into
your master’s house, by the brewhouse door, between
one and two o’clock on the seventeenth of last
month?’</p>

<p>‘Sir,’ said Jacob Wincher, steadily returning the
questioner’s steady gaze, ‘as surely as there is a
higher Power above us both, that knows and judges
what we do and say, I have told you nothing but the
truth. I let no one into my master’s house on that
night or any other night.’</p>

<p>‘What! You had no light burning long after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
midnight—you set no candle in one of the upper
rooms for a signal—you never gave your accomplice
a lodging in one of the attics? Why, I tell you,
man, I found the bed he had slept in—the ashes of
the fire that warmed him—his empty brandy bottle!
If you want to go scot-free yourself, or to be paid
handsomely for your candour, the truth will best
serve you, Mr. Wincher. Who was the man you
kept hidden in that upstair room at Cedar House?’</p>

<p>‘I can but repeat what I have said, sir. I never
admitted any living creature to that house surreptitiously.
I never lodged so much as a strange cat
in those upstair rooms. How could I? Miss Lucille
always kept the key of the upper staircase.’</p>

<p>‘Pshaw! What was to prevent your having a
duplicate key?’ exclaimed Lucius impatiently.</p>

<p>This old man’s protestations sounded like truth;
but Lucius told himself they could not be truth. After
all, when a man has once made things easy with
his conscience—settled with himself that he will not
attempt to square his life by the right angle of fair
dealing—there need be nothing so very difficult in
lying. It can only be a matter of invention and self-possession.</p>

<p>‘Come, Mr. Wincher,’ said Lucius, after a pause;
‘believe me, candour will best serve your interests.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
I know the name of your accomplice, and I am ready
to believe that you were ignorant of the darker purpose
which brought him to that house. I am ready
to believe that you had no hand in the attempt to
poison your old master.’</p>

<p>‘Sir,’ said Jacob Wincher, with another solemn
appeal to the Highest of all Judges, ‘all that you
say is incomprehensible to me. I admitted no one.
I know nothing of any attempt to injure my old
master, whom I have served faithfully and with affection
for five-and-twenty years. I know no more of
the robbery than I told you when I informed you of
it. There is some mistake, sir.’</p>

<p>‘What, will you tell me that my own senses
have deceived me—that I did not see the door opened
and the light in the upper window that night? Who
was there in the house to open that door or set that
beacon light in the window except you—or Miss
Sivewright?’</p>

<p>Or Miss Sivewright! What if it was Lucille
who opened the door—Lucille who gave the man
shelter in that upper room? Was she not capable
of any act, however desperate, for the sake of the
father she loved with such a morbid affection? If
he came to her as a suppliant, entreating for shelter,
pleading perhaps for her influence to bring about a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
reconciliation between himself and his father, would
this fond confiding daughter refuse to admit him?
Would she foresee the danger of his presence in that
house; or could her innocent mind conceive so deep
a guilt as that of the would-be parricide?</p>

<p>A new light broke in upon Lucius Davoren’s
mind. He remembered all that had been strange
in Lucille’s manner and conduct since the evening
when they went up to the loft and he saw the opening
of the attic door. He remembered her anxiety
on that occasion—her agitation on every subsequent
recurrence to the same subject—her impatient denial
of any foundation for his suspicions about the
Winchers—how she fell unconscious at his feet when
he plainly declared his discovery; and last of all,
that fever in which the mind rather than the body
had been affected. He recalled her wandering words,
in which the name of father had been so often reiterated,
and, most significant of all, that strange
appeal which Mrs. Milderson had repeated to him,
‘You couldn’t be so wicked as to poison your poor
old father.’ To whom but a son could those words
have been spoken? And could delirium suggest so
deep a horror if it were utterly baseless?</p>

<p>‘No, it was memory, and not a mind distraught,
that shaped those fearful words,’ thought Lucius.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>He was silent for some time, pondering this new
view of the question. Jacob Wincher waited patiently,
his poor old head shaking a little from the agitation
of the foregoing conversation. Jacob Wincher’s good
lady stood with her arms folded, like a statue of
female stoicism, as if it were a point of honour with
her not to move a muscle.</p>

<p>‘Well, Mr. Wincher,’ said Lucius at last, ‘it is
not for me to decide whether you are guilty or innocent.
You will hardly deny that circumstances conspired
to condemn you. I did what I felt to be my
duty when I advised Mr. Sivewright to dismiss you.’</p>

<p>‘After five-and-twenty years, and never a fault
to find with neither of us,’ interjected Mrs. Wincher.</p>

<p>‘The result has in a considerable measure justified
that act. The attempt to poison a helpless
old man has made no further progress.’</p>

<p>Jacob Wincher cast up his eyes in mute appeal
to heaven, but said nothing.</p>

<p>‘We could have poisoned him in Bond-street,
if we’d wanted to it,’ protested Mrs. Wincher. ‘It
would only ’a been to cook his bit of minced weal or
Irish stew in a verding-greasy copper saucepan, and
all the juries as ever sat couldn’t have brought it
home to us.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>‘Now, if you are, as you allege, an innocent man,’
pursued Lucius thoughtfully, ‘you will be glad to
give me the utmost assistance. I have made a discovery
that may in some measure affect this question.
Ferdinand Sivewright is alive, and probably
in England!’</p>

<p>‘Then it was he who stole that silver!’ cried the
old man, starting up with sudden energy.</p>

<p>‘Is not that a hasty conclusion?’</p>

<p>‘You would not say so, sir, if you knew that
young man as well as I do. He was capable of anything—clever
enough for anything in the way of
wickedness. The most artful man couldn’t be a
match for him. He deceived me; he hoodwinked
his father, over and over again. There was no lock
that could keep anything from him. He robbed his
father in every way that it was possible for a man
to rob, and looked in his face all the time, and
shammed innocence. His mother had trained him
to lie and cheat before he could speak plain. If
Ferdinand Sivewright is in England, Ferdinand
Sivewright is the thief.’</p>

<p>‘And the poisoner?’ asked Lucius.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know! Perhaps. He did not shrink
from stupefying his father’s senses with an opiate,
when it suited his purpose. He may have grown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
more hardened in wickedness since then, and may
be capable of trying to poison him.’</p>

<p>‘Mind, I do not say that he is in England,’
said Lucius, ‘only that he may be. Now, there is
one thing very clear to me, namely, that whoever
put the arsenic in that medicine must have entered
your master’s room by the secret staircase. Mr.
Sivewright’s door was kept locked at night, and his
room was carefully watched by day—especially during
the two or three days immediately before my
discovery of the poison. Now, you pretend to have
been ignorant of the existence of that staircase until
I showed it to you.’</p>

<p>‘I have told you nothing but the truth, sir.’</p>

<p>‘But if you, who had lived in that house for
several years, knew nothing about it, how should
a stranger, coming into the house by stealth, discover
it?’</p>

<p>‘I cannot tell you, sir,’ answered the old man
helplessly.</p>

<p>‘Does your master know of that staircase, do you
think?’</p>

<p>‘He may, sir, though he never mentioned it to
me. He is a close gentlemen at all times. He
chose the room he now sleeps in for his bedroom
when we first came to the house. He would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
no painting, or whitewashing, or repairs of any kind
done—saying that the place was good enough for
him, and he didn’t want to waste money upon it.
My wife cleaned up the rooms as well as she could,
and that was all that was done. There were no
workmen spying about, to find out secret staircases
or anything else.’</p>

<p>‘From whom did your master take the house?’
asked Lucius.</p>

<p>‘From an agent, Mr. Agar, in the Shadrack-road.’</p>

<p>‘To whom does it belong?’</p>

<p>‘I’ve never heard, sir; but I believe it’s the property
of somebody that lives abroad. Mr. Agar always
collected the rent half-yearly.’</p>

<p>‘Then, no doubt, Mr. Agar knows all about that
staircase,’ said Lucius; ‘I’ll go to him at once.’</p>

<p>‘Heaven grant you may be able to come at the
truth, sir; though I can’t see how that staircase can
help you.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know about that, Mr. Wincher,’ returned
Lucius; and with a hasty ‘Good-morning,’ he departed.</p>

<span class="fs70">MR. AGAR’S COLONIAL CLIENT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Lucius</span> went straight to Mr. Agar’s office—a little
wedge-shaped box of a place squeezed corner-wise off
a larger shop, for space was precious in the Shadrack-road.
In this small temple of industry, Mr. Agar
professed himself ready to value property, survey
estates, sell by auction, let lands, houses, or apartments,
collect rents, and even at a push to undertake
the conduct of genteel funerals.</p>

<p>Here Lucius found him—a busy little man, with
a bald head, and an ear that had been pushed into
high relief by having a pen continually stuck behind
it.</p>

<p>‘Pray, what can I do for you, sir?’ he asked,
with his fingers in his order-book, ready to write an
order to view any species of property within a ten-mile
radius of the Shadrack-road.</p>

<p>‘I want to ask you a few questions about a house
in which I am interested.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>‘As an intending tenant, sir, or purchaser?’
inquired Mr. Agar, turning round upon his high
stool, and nursing his leg, in an attitude which was
at once easy and inviting to confidence.</p>

<p>‘Certainly not as a tenant, for the house is let.’</p>

<p>‘As a purchaser, then?’ exclaimed Mr. Agar,
stimulated by the vision of five per cent. ‘Have
we’—a very grand we—‘advertised the property?’</p>

<p>‘No, Mr. Agar; nor have I any reason to suppose
that it is for sale.’</p>

<p>‘But you think that we might negotiate something—make
a speculative offer—eh?’ inquired the
agent briskly. ‘My dear sir, in any delicate little
matter of that kind, you may rely upon my discretion—and
I think I may venture to say, upon my
diplomatic powers.’</p>

<p>‘I want you to answer two or three plain questions,
Mr. Agar—that is all. Some years ago you
let Cedar House to my friend and patient, Mr. Sivewright.’</p>

<p>‘Cedar House—dear me, that is really curious;
not an attractive property, one would think—no
frontage to speak of—house out of repair, and
yet—’</p>

<p>‘And yet what, Mr. Agar?’</p>

<p>‘Let me answer your inquiries first, sir.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>‘In the first place, then, to whom does the house
belong?’</p>

<p>‘To two old maiden ladies, who reside in Paris.
Their grandfather was a great man in the City—a
brassfounder, I believe—and lived at Cedar House
in very grand style, but not within the memory of
anybody now living. The house has degenerated
since his day, but it is still a valuable property. As
a public institution, now, it would offer great advantages;
or it might be made the nucleus of a large
fortune to a medical practitioner in the shape of a
private lunatic asylum,’ added the agent, with a sharp
glance at Lucius.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Agar, I am bound to inform you that I am
not on the look-out for a house for the purpose you
suggest. But I am very curious to know all about
Cedar House. When you let it to Mr. Sivewright
were you aware of a secret staircase, which ascends
from an outbuilding at the back to the first
floor?’</p>

<p>‘And to the attic floor,’ said the agent.</p>

<p>‘What, does it go higher than the first floor?’</p>

<p>‘It ascends to one of the rooms on the upper
story, sir. A fact you might have discovered for
yourself if you had taken the trouble to examine
the staircase thoroughly; but it’s an abominably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
crooked and dangerous place, and I don’t wonder you
left some portion of it unexplored.’</p>

<p>‘To which of the upper rooms does it ascend?’
asked Lucius eagerly.</p>

<p>‘To the north-east attic. There is a door at the
back of the closet in that room—you’d hardly distinguish
it from the rest of the panelling—communicating
with that staircase.’</p>

<p>‘Did Mr. Sivewright know of the staircase when
you let the house to him?’</p>

<p>Mr. Agar was silent for a few moments, and
rubbed his bald head meditatively.</p>

<p>‘Well, no. I doubt if he heard of it; that is
to say, I don’t remember mentioning it. You see,
to the candid mind,’ continued the agent, taking a
high moral tone, ‘there is something peculiarly repellent
in secrecy; even a secret staircase is not a
pleasant idea. And the house had acquired a queer
reputation in the neighbourhood. Noises had been
heard—strange cats, no doubt—silly people even pretended
to having seen things; in short, the ignorant
populace described the house as haunted. Idle boys
chalked “Beware of the ghost” on the garden wall;
and when a tenant came forward at last in the person
of Mr. Sivewright—a somewhat eccentric old
gentleman, as you are no doubt aware, but most upright<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
and honourable in his dealings—I was glad to
let him the old place at a ridiculously low rent.’</p>

<p>‘And you did not show him the staircase?’</p>

<p>‘No, I certainly didn’t show it to him.’</p>

<p>‘Nor tell him anything about it?’</p>

<p>‘I cannot recall having mentioned it.’</p>

<p>‘Then I think we may take it for granted that
he knows nothing about it. By the way, how does
the communication work with the room on the first
floor—it’s a sliding panel, I suppose?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; there’s a bit of moulding on one of the
panels that looks rather loose; press that inwards,
and the panel slides behind the other part of the
wainscot. I don’t suppose it works very easily, for
it must be a long time since it was used.’</p>

<p>‘Do you know for what purpose this staircase
was originally built?’</p>

<p>‘No, sir; that end of the house belongs, I believe,
to Henry the Eighth’s time. That staircase is built
in what was once a great square chimney—the chimney
of the old banqueting-hall, in fact; for there
was a banqueting-hall in Cedar House in Henry the
Eighth’s time, though there’s nothing left of it now;
that end is clean gone, except the said chimney. I
got an architect to look over the place once for the
Miss Chadwicks, my clients, with a view to reparation;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
but the reparations mounted up so, that when
the elder Miss Chadwick got the specification she
wrote and told me she and her sister would sooner
have the place pulled down at once, and sold for
building materials, than lay out such a lot of money;
for they are rather close, are the Miss Chadwicks.
The architect didn’t seem to think that old chimney
over safe either, on account of their having pulled
down the hall, and took away its supports, in a measure.
“But it’ll last our time, I daresay,” says he;
“and if it falls it’s bound to fall outwards, where it
can’t hurt anybody.” For, as I daresay you are
aware, there’s only a bit of waste ground—a cat-walk,
as you may say—on that side of the house.’</p>

<p>‘Rather a hazardous condition though for a house
to be left in,’ said Lucius, thinking that this would
give him a new incentive to find a better home for
Lucille speedily. ‘Then you don’t know why that
staircase was built, nor who built it?’</p>

<p>‘Well, no, sir; I can’t say I do. I’ve often
wondered about it. You see, the staircase may not
have been a secret one in the first instance, but may
have been converted to a means of escape in the
troublesome times that came later. There is no
allusion to it in any of the deeds belonging to the
house.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>‘You spoke just now of my inquiry being curious,’
said Lucius after a pause; ‘why was that?’</p>

<p>‘I thought it rather strange that you should
make an inquiry about Cedar House, because some
six weeks ago I had another gentleman here who
made the same inquiry.’</p>

<p>‘About the staircase?’</p>

<p>‘No, he didn’t inquire about the staircase. I
told him about that afterwards, in the course of conversation,
and he seemed struck by the fact. We
had a good bit of talk together, first and last, for he
was a very free and open kind of a gentleman, and had
just come from Australia, or America, I really forget
which, and he insisted on standing a bottle of champagne—a
thing I shouldn’t have cared to partake of
in the middle of the day, if he hadn’t been so pressing.’</p>

<p>‘What kind of man was he?’ asked Lucius, burning
with impatience.</p>

<p>‘Well, a good-looking fellow enough, but rather
peculiar-looking with it. Tall and thin, with a sallow
complexion, and the blackest eyes and hair I ever
saw in a European. The hair grew in a little peak
on his forehead, such as I’ve heard some facetious
folks call a widower’s peak. It was rather noticeable.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>‘The very man!’ muttered Lucius.</p>

<p>‘Do you know the gentleman, sir?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I think he is a person I know. And pray
what inquiries did he make about the house?’</p>

<p>‘More than I can remember,’ answered the agent;
‘there never was such a gentleman for asking questions,
and so business-like too. He made me take
a sheet of paper and sketch him out a plan of the
house in pencil—how all the rooms lay, and the
passages and stairs, and so on. That’s how we
came to speak of the private staircase. He seemed
quite taken aback by the notion. It might be
handy, he said, and work into something that he
wanted.’</p>

<p>‘What motive did he state for these inquiries?’</p>

<p>‘They were made with a view to making an offer
for the property, which I had reason to think my
clients, the Miss Chadwicks, would be not unwilling
to part with. The gentleman is trying to get
a patent for an invention of his, which will make
his fortune when carried out, he says, and he wants
good roomy premises within an easy distance of the
docks. A thorough man of business, I can assure
you, though only just returned from abroad,’ added
Mr. Agar, as if England were the only country in
which business was properly understood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>‘Has this gentleman made any attempt to forward
the transaction?’ asked Lucius. ‘Have you
ever seen him since the day when he treated you to
champagne?’</p>

<p>‘Treated is hardly the word, sir!’ said Mr. Agar
with dignity. ‘The gentleman <em>stood</em> a bottle of
Peerer Jewitt. It was as much for his pleasure as
for mine.’</p>

<p>‘I have no doubt of that, Mr. Agar. But have
you seen any more of this agreeable gentleman?’</p>

<p>‘No, sir, he hasn’t been in here since. I fancy
there’s some difficulty about the patent. It isn’t
easy to hurry things where you’ve got to deal with
Government offices. But I expect to hear from
him before very long. He was quite the gentleman.’</p>

<p>‘I doubt if you will ever see him again, Mr.
Agar, gentleman or not; if he be the man I take
him for.’</p>

<p>‘Indeed, sir. Do you know anything to the gentleman’s
disadvantage?’</p>

<p>‘Only that he is a most consummate villain.’</p>

<p>‘Good gracious me, sir. That’s a sweeping
charge.’</p>

<p>‘It is, Mr. Agar; and I am unable just now to
substantiate it. I can only thank you for the information<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
you have kindly given me, and wish you
good-morning.’</p>

<p>He left the little office, glad to be in the open
air again to have room to breathe, and to be able to
contemplate this new aspect of affairs alone.</p>

<p>‘He is here then, and henceforward it must be a
hand-to-hand fight between us two.’</p>

<span class="fs70">LUCILLE’S CONFESSION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">One</span> of Lucius Davoren’s first thoughts, after that
interview with the house-agent, was of his sister
Janet and of Geoffrey Hossack. The discovery, which
lifted a load from his conscience, changed the aspect
of Geoffrey’s fortunes. The man who had married
Janet still lived, and whether the marriage were
legal or not—a fact difficult of ascertainment in a
life so full of double-dealing—Janet would doubtless
count herself bound to him. She had told Lucius,
when they met at Stillmington, that she did so consider
herself; and he knew that calm proud nature
too well not to know that she would be firm, whatever
sorrow to herself were involved in such constancy.</p>

<p>Lucius lost no time in writing to Geoffrey, at
the Cosmopolitan, the only safe address for that nomadic
gentleman. He knew that the people at the
Cosmopolitan were generally acquainted with Mr.
Hossack’s whereabouts, and had instructions to forward
his letters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>Lucius wrote briefly thus:</p>
<br>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Dear Geoffrey,—The last week has been full of
discoveries. I have seen Absalom Schanck, and
learned from him that I am guiltless of that scoundrel’s
blood—a surprise which has infinitely relieved
my mind, but which has also given me new cause for
uneasiness. To you, poor old Geoff, I fear it will
be a disappointment to learn that Janet’s husband is
still in the land of the living; but I hope that this
knowledge may have a beneficial effect, and help to
cure you of a foolish passion, which I told you from
the first was hopeless. Would to heaven, for your
sake and Janet’s, that it were otherwise! But Fate
is stronger than man. And, after all, there are
plenty of charming women in the world who would
be proud to call Geoffrey Hossack husband.</p>

<p>‘I try to write lightly, but I am full of anxiety.
This man’s existence means peril for those I love,
and I know not what shape the danger may assume.
Let me hear of you soon.—Ever yours,</p>

<p class="right">
‘<span class="smcap">Lucius Davoren</span>.’<br>
</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>Ferdinand Sivewright’s existence meant peril for
his old father and for the innocent girl who believed
herself to be his daughter. Of that fact Lucius had
no doubt, and the one question was how to meet the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
danger. That the old house was now securely defended,
he felt tolerably sure—as sure as one could
be about a rambling old place which was all doors
and windows, and for aught he knew might still be
approachable by some hidden way that had escaped
his ken. The great point now would be to prove to
Lucille that this man had no claim upon her; that
no tie bound her to him, not even the duty of common
gratitude for any kindness shown to her in
her childhood, since he had made her existence an
excuse for extorting money from her father. He,
Lucius, must show her that the fancy which her
girlish heart had cherished—the fond belief in
this father’s love—was more baseless than the
dreams of fever, wilder than the fancies of madness.
How would he prove this to her? He might show
her those letters. But would the evidence of the
letters be strong enough to dispel so deep-rooted a
belief, so long-cherished a fancy?</p>

<p>No, Lucius told himself. The letters, which told
their story plainly enough for him, might fail to convince
Lucille.</p>

<p>‘I must have some stronger proof than the letters,’
he thought.</p>

<p>How to obtain that proof, how to begin the search
that was to end in the discovery of Lucille’s parentage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
was the question which now absorbed all his
thoughts. He had made up his mind to seek no
assistance in this difficult task. Whatever blunders
he might make, however awkwardly he might transact
a business so foreign to the bent of his life, he
would do this work for himself, and succeed or fail
unaided.</p>

<p>‘If there is a stain upon her birth, no one but I
shall discover it,’ he said to himself.</p>

<p>Homer Sivewright had read those letters as relating
to a secret marriage, yet their wording might
be taken to indicate a less honourable relation between
the gentleman who signed himself H. G. and
the lady who called herself Madame Dumarques.</p>

<p>Throughout the letters there was but one positive
clue to the identification of the writers. That lay in
the address given by the lady, at Rouen. She was
staying in that city with friends—relations perhaps.
It was just possible that Lucius might be so fortunate
as to find some of these people still resident in
the same city. The date of the letters was only
fourteen years ago, and in some slow tranquil lives
fourteen years make but little difference. The hair
grows a shade grayer; the favourite old dog or the
familiar household cat dies, and is replaced by a
younger and less cherished animal; the ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
asthmatic canary is found dead in his cage; the old
Sunday silk gown, which has been worn with honour
for a decade, is converted into a petticoat; the old
husband takes to stronger spectacles, and shortens
his constitutional walk by the length of a couple of
streets; the old wife dies perhaps, and is buried and
feebly mourned for a little while; and with such
faint ripples of change the slow dull river glides on
to the eternal ocean.</p>

<p>Lucius was hopeful that, in a quiet by-street in
the city of Rouen, he might find things very much
as they had been fourteen years ago. He made up
his mind to start for that city on the following night.
A train leaving London-bridge at dusk would take
him to Newhaven; he would reach Dieppe by six
o’clock next morning, and Rouen by breakfast time.
Once there he knew not how long his researches
might detain him; but he could so arrange his
affairs, with the help of a good-natured brother-medico
in the Shadrack district, as to absent himself
for a few days without inconvenience to his numerous
patients.</p>

<p>That one dear patient whose safety was so near
to his heart was now out of danger. The fever was
past, and the only symptom which now gave him
cause for anxiety was a deep melancholy, as of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
mind overburdened with care, or weighed down by
some painful secret.</p>

<p>‘Could I but dare to speak openly I might dispel
some of those apprehensions which now disturb her,’
thought Lucius; ‘but I cannot venture to do that
until she is better able to bear the shock of a great
surprise, and until I am able to confirm my statements.’</p>

<p>Lucille was now well enough to come down to
the old wainscoted parlour, where her lover had first
seen her on that dark winter’s night which, when
looked back upon, seemed like the beginning of a new
life. Mr. Sivewright still kept his room, but had
improved considerably, and had relented towards Mrs.
Milderson, whom he graciously allowed to minister
to his wants, and would even permit to discourse
to him occasionally of the domestic annals of those
lady patients into whose family circles she was from
time to time admitted. He would make no farther
protest than an impatient sniff when the worthy
nurse stood for a quarter of an hour, cup-and-saucer
in hand, relating, with aggravating precision of date
and amplitude of detail, the little differences between
Mr. Binks the chandler and his good lady on the
subject of washing-days, or the ‘stand-further’ between
Mrs. Binks and ‘the girl.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>Under the gentle sway of Mrs. Milderson, who
was really an honest and sober specimen of her race,
demanding only a moderate supply of those creature-comforts
which the Gamp tribe are apt to require,
life had gone very smoothly at Cedar House. Mrs.
Magsby took charge of the lower part of the premises
and her own baby (which seemed to absorb the
greater part of her attention), and was altogether a
mild and harmless person. Mr. Magsby, as guardian
of the house, did nothing particular but walk about
with a somewhat drowsy air, and smoke his pipe in
open doorways, looking up at the sky, and enunciating
speculative prophecies about the weather, which,
as he never went out of doors, could have been of very
little consequence to him.</p>

<p>Thus administered, what citadel could seem more
secure than Cedar House? Lucius, after thinking of
the subject from every possible point of view, decided
that he could run no hazard in absenting himself
for a few days. He went at the usual hour that afternoon,
when his day’s work was done. Lucille seemed
a little brighter and happier than she had been of
late, and the change cheered him.</p>

<p>‘My darling,’ he said fondly, as he looked down
at the pale face, which had lost something of its care-worn
expression, ‘you have almost your old tranquil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
look—that calm sweet face which came upon me like
a surprise one dark November night, nearly a year
ago, when yonder door opened, and you came in,
carrying a little tray.’</p>

<p>‘How well you remember things, Lucius! Yes,
I have been happier to-day. I have been sitting with
grandpapa, and he really seems much better. You
do think him improved, don’t you, Lucius?’</p>

<p>‘I think him on the high-road to recovery. We
may have him hale and vigorous yet, Lucille—sitting
by the hearth in our new home.’</p>

<p>‘Our new home—yes,’ said the girl, looking
round her with a perceptible shudder, ‘I shall be
glad to leave this dull old house some day. It is full
of horrible thoughts. But now that I am well again,
I can take care of grandpapa.’</p>

<p>‘Not quite well yet, Lucille; you want care yourself.’</p>

<p>‘I should think she do, indeed,’ said Mrs. Milderson,
who came in with the tea-tray, having discreetly
allowed the lovers time for greeting; ‘and
care she shall have, and her beef-tea reglar, and no
liberties took, which invalidses’ mistake is always to
think they’re well ever so long before they are. There
was Mrs. Binks, only the other day, down in the shop
serving the Saturday-night customers, which is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
better nor Injun American savages in the impatience
of their ways, before that blessed baby was three
weeks old.’</p>

<p>‘I think I can rely upon you to take care of both
my patients, nurse, while I am away for a few days.’</p>

<p>‘You are going away, Lucius?’ said Lucille
anxiously.</p>

<p>‘Yes, dear; but for two or three days only. I
think I may venture to leave you in Mrs. Milderson’s
care for that time.’</p>

<p>‘I should hope you could, sir,’ exclaimed that
matron, ‘after having had two years’ experience of
me in all capacities—and even the old gentleman up-stairs,
which was inclined to be grumpy and standoffish
at first, having took to me as he has.’</p>

<p>‘I shall be quite safe, Lucius,’ said Lucille, ‘but
I shall miss you very much.’</p>

<p>‘It shall be only for a few days, dearest. Nothing
but important business would tempt me away from
you even for that time.’</p>

<p>‘Important business, Lucius! What can that
be? Is it another visit to that tiresome friend of
yours, Mr. Hossack?’</p>

<p>‘No, dear, it is something which concerns our
own future—something which I hope may bring you
a new happiness. If I succeed in what I am going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
to attempt, you shall know all about it, and quickly.
If I fail—’</p>

<p>‘What then, Lucius?’ she asked, as he hesitated.</p>

<p>‘Better that you should never know anything,
darling, for then you can feel no disappointment.’</p>

<p>‘O!’ said Lucille, with a little sigh of resignation.
‘I suppose it is something connected with
your professional career, some ambitious project
which is to make me very proud of you if you succeed
in it. Are you going very far?’</p>

<p>‘To Rouen.’</p>

<p>‘Rouen!’ cried Lucille; ‘Rouen in France?’
with as much astonishment as if he had said the
centre of Africa.</p>

<p>‘To Rouen, in the department of the lower
Seine,’ he answered gaily; with assumed gaiety, for
it pained him even to leave her for so brief a span.</p>

<p>‘What can take you to France?’</p>

<p>‘Simply that ambitious project you spoke of just
now. My dearest girl, you look as distressed as if I
were going to Australia, when my journey is only a
question of three or four days. I shall leave London
to-morrow evening, and be in Rouen before noon next
day. A day, or at most two days, will, I trust, accomplish
my business there. I shall travel at night both
ways, so as to save time; and on the fourth day I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
hope to be back in this dear old parlour drinking tea
with you and nurse.’</p>

<p>‘Of course!’ exclaimed Mrs. Milderson, as if she
had known all about it from the very beginning.
‘Do you suppose Dr. Davoren would go wasting of
his precious time in France or anywheres else, with
all his patients fretting and worriting about him—and
left to the mercy of a strange doctor, which don’t know
the ins and outs of their cases, and the little peculiarities
of their constitushuns, no more than a baby?’</p>

<p>After tea Mrs. Milderson retired with the tray,
and was absent for some time in attendance on Mr.
Sivewright, who took his light repast of dry toast and
tea also at this hour. Thus Lucius and Lucille were
alone together for a little while. They stood side by
side at the open window, which commanded no wider
prospect than the bare courtyard or garden, where a
few weakly chrysanthemums languished in a neglected
bed, and two or three feeble sycamores invited
the dust, while one ancient poplar, whose branches
had grown thin and ragged with age, straggled up
towards the calm evening sky. A high wall bounded
this barren domain and shut out the world beyond it.</p>

<p>‘We must go up to grandpapa presently,’ said
Lucille; ‘he likes us to sit with him for an hour or
two in the evening now that he is so much better.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>‘Yes, dear, we will go; but before we go I want
to ask you about something that has often set me
wondering, yet which in all our talk we have spoken
of very little.’</p>

<p>‘What is that, Lucius?’</p>

<p>‘About your earliest memories of childhood, Lucille.
The time before you lived in Bond-street with
your grandfather.’</p>

<p>To his surprise and distress she turned from him
suddenly, and burst into tears.</p>

<p>‘My darling, I did not mean to grieve you!’ he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>‘Then never speak to me again of my childhood,
Lucius,’ she said with sorrowful earnestness. ‘It is
a subject I can never speak of, never think of, without
grief. Never again, if you wish me to be happy,
mention the name of father.’</p>

<p>‘What?’ said Lucius; ’then that dream is over?’</p>

<p>‘It is,’ answered Lucille, in a heartbroken voice,
‘and the awakening has been most bitter.’</p>

<p>‘Thank Heaven that awakening has come, Lucille—even
at the cost of pain to your true and tender
heart,’ replied her lover earnestly. ‘My dearest, I
am not going to torture you with questions. The
mystery of these last few weeks has been slowly
growing clear to me. There has been a great peril<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
hanging over us; but I believe and hope that it is
past. Of your innocent share in bringing that danger
beneath this roof, I will say not a word.’</p>

<p>‘What, you know, Lucius?’ she said, with a perplexed
look.</p>

<p>‘I know, or can guess, all, Lucille. How your
too faithful affection has been traded upon by a
villain.’</p>

<p>‘O, do not speak of him!’ she cried. ‘Remember,
how ever dark his guilt may be, I once loved
him—once, and O, so long, believed in him; hoped
that he was only unfortunate, and not wicked; clung
to the thought that he was the victim of circumstances.
Lucius, have some pity upon me. Since
that night when you first spoke of your dreadful fear—first
suggested that some one was trying to poison
my poor old grandfather—I have lived in a horrible
dream. Nothing has seemed clear to me. Life has
been all terror and confusion. Tell me once for all,
is it true that some one tried to poison him—is it
true?’</p>

<p>Words failed her. She stopped, stifled by sobs.</p>

<p>‘Lucille, do not speak of these things,’ said
Lucius, drawing the too fragile form to his breast,
smoothing the loose hair on the pale forehead. ‘Is
it not enough to know that the danger is past? That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
fatal blindness—the fatal delusion which made you
cling to the memory of a bad man—has been dispelled.
You will never admit Ferdinand Sivewright to this
house again.’</p>

<p>He looked at the pale face resting on his shoulder
as he made this straight assertion. There was no
indignant denial, not even surprise in the look of
those plaintive eyes which were slowly lifted to meet
his own—a beseeching look, as of one who asked
forgiveness for a great wrong.</p>

<p>‘I have been more than foolish,’ she said, with a
shudder, as if at some terrible memory. ‘I have
been very wicked. If my grandfather had died, I
should have been an unconscious accomplice in his
murder. But he <em>is</em> my father; and when he came to
me, after so many years of separation, shelterless,
hopeless, only pleading for a refuge, and the opportunity
to win his father’s pardon—O Lucius, I can
never tell you how he pleaded, by the memory of his
old love for me—’</p>

<p>‘His love for you! I trust you may soon know,
dearest, what that love was worth.’</p>

<p>‘Heaven grant I may never see his face or hear
his name again, Lucius. The memory of him is all
horror.’</p>

<p>‘You shall not be troubled by him any more if I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
can help it,’ answered her lover tenderly. ‘But you
will never again keep a secret from me, will you,
dearest?’</p>

<p>‘Never, Lucius. I have suffered too much from
this one sin against your love. But if you knew
how he pleaded, you would forgive me. You would
not even wonder that I was so weak. Think, Lucius;
a repentant son pleading for admission to his
father’s house, without a roof to cover him, and
longing for a reconciliation with the father he had
offended.’</p>

<p>‘My poor confiding child, you were made the
dupe of a villain. Tell me no more than you like to
tell; but if it is any relief to you to speak—’</p>

<p>‘It is, Lucius. Yes, it is a relief to trust you.
I thought I never could have told you. The burden
of this dreadful secret has weighed down my heart.
I dared not tell you. I thought you would bitterly
reproach me for having kept such a secret from you,
and then it is such pain to speak of him—now—now
that I know he was never worthy of my love. But
you are so kind, and it will relieve my mind to tell
you all.’</p>

<p>‘Speak freely then, darling, and fear no reproaches
from me.’</p>

<p>‘It was while you were away at Stillmington,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
Lucius, that this secret first began. I was in the
garden alone, at dusk one evening.’</p>

<p>Lucius remembered what Mrs. Wincher had told
him about Lucille coming in from the garden with a
pale horror-stricken face, and saying that she had
seen a ghost.</p>

<p>‘I was low-spirited because of your absence, and
a little nervous. The place seemed so dull and
lonely. All the common sounds of the day were
over, and there was something oppressive in the
silence, and the hot smoky atmosphere, and the dim
gray sky. I was standing in the old summer-house,
looking at the creek, and thinking of you, and trying
to have happy thoughts about brighter days to come—only
the happy thoughts would not stay with me—when
I saw a man come from the wharf on the other
side of the water, and step lightly from barge to
barge. I was frightened, for the man had a strange
look somehow, and was oddly dressed, buttoned to
the neck in a shabby greatcoat, and with his face
overshadowed by a felt hat that was slouched over
his forehead. He came so quickly that I had hardly
time to think before he had got upon the low garden
wall, and dropped down close to the summer-house.
I think I gave a little scream just then, for he came
in, and put his hand across my lips. Not roughly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
but so as to prevent my calling out. “Lucille,” he
said, “don’t you know me? Am I so changed that
my dear little daughter, who loved me so well once,
doesn’t know me?” The voice was like the memory
of a dream. I had not an instant’s doubt. All fear
vanished in that great joy. The sad sweet thought
of the past came back to me. The firelit parlour
where I had sat at his feet—that strange wild music—his
voice—his face—he had taken off his hat now,
and was looking down at me with those dark bright
eyes. I remembered him as well as if we had been
only parted a few days.’</p>

<p>‘And was there nothing in his presence—in the
tone of his voice, the expression of his face—from
which your better instinct recoiled? Had nature no
warning for you? Did you not feel that there was
something of the serpent’s charm in the influence
which this man had exercised over you?’</p>

<p>Lucille was silent for a few moments, looking
thoughtfully downwards, as if questioning her own
memory.</p>

<p>‘I can scarcely tell you what I felt in that moment,’
she said. ‘Joy was uppermost in my mind.
How could I feel otherwise than happy in the return
of the father I had mourned as dead? Then came
pity for him. His worn haggard face—his threadbare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
clothes—spoke of struggle and hardship. He
told me very briefly the story of a life that had been
one long failure, and how he found himself at this
hour newly returned from America, and cast penniless
and shelterless upon the stones of the London streets.
“If you can’t give me a hole to lie in somewhere in
that big house, I must go out and try to get lodged in
the workhouse, or steal a loaf and get rather better fare
in a gaol.” That was what he said, Lucius. He told
me what difficulties he had encountered in his search
after me. “My heart yearned for you, Lucille,” he
said; “it was the thought of you and of the poor
old father that brought me back from America.”’</p>

<p>‘And no instinct warned you that this man was
lying?’</p>

<p>‘O no, no; I had no such thought as that,’ answered
Lucille quickly. ‘Yet I confess,’ she went
on more deliberately, ‘there was a vague feeling of
disappointment in my mind. This long-lost father,
so unexpectedly restored to me, did not seem quite
all that I had dreamed him; there was something
wanting to make my joy perfect—there was a doubt
or a fear in my mind which took no definite shape.
I only felt that my father’s return did not make me
so happy as it ought to have done.’</p>

<p>‘Did he see this, do you think?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>‘I don’t know. But when I hesitated about admitting
him to the house—unknown to my grandfather—he
reproached me for my want of natural
affection. “The world is alike all over,” he said;
“and even a daughter has no welcome for a pauper;
though he comes three thousand miles to look at the
girl who used to sit on his knee and put her soft
little arms round his neck, and vow she loved him
better than any one else in the world.” I told him
how cruel this accusation was, and how I had remembered
him and loved him all through these long
years, and how the dearest wish of my heart had
been for such a meeting as this. But I said that I
did not like to keep his return a secret from his
father, and I begged him to let me take him straight
to my grandfather, and to trust to a father’s natural
affection for forgiveness of all that had severed them
in the past. My father greeted this suggestion with
scornful laughter. “Natural affection!” he exclaimed.
“Did he show much natural affection when he turned
me out of doors? Did he show natural affection to my
mother when his cruelty drove her out of his house?
Has he ever spoken of me with natural affection
during the last ten years? Answer me that, Lucille!”
What answer could I give him, Lucius? You know
how my grandfather has always spoken of his only son.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>‘Yes, dear; and I know what your grandfather’s
affection concealed from you—the shameful cause of
that severance between father and son.’</p>

<p>‘I could give him no hopeful answer. “I see,”
he said, “there has been no relenting. Homer Sivewright
is made of iron. Come, child, all I want is
a shelter. Am I to have it here or in the workhouse,
or, in fault of that, a gaol? If I sleep in the street
another night I shall be in for a rheumatic fever.
I’ve had all manner of aches and pains in my bones
for some days past.” “You shall not sleep in the
streets,” I said, “while I have power to give you shelter.”
I thought of all those empty rooms on the top
floor. I had the key of the staircase always in my
own charge, and thought it would be easy enough to
keep any one up there for weeks, and months even,
without my grandfather or the Winchers ever knowing
anything about it. Or if the worst came to the
worst, I thought I might venture to trust the Winchers
with the secret. “Have you made up your mind?”
asked my father impatiently. “Yes, papa,” I said—and
the old name came back so naturally—“I have made
up my mind.” I told him he must wait a little, till
Mr. and Mrs. Wincher were safely out of the way,
and then I would take him into the house; unless
he would make up his mind to trust the Winchers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
with his secret. “I will trust not a living creature
but yourself,” he said; “and if you tell any one a
word about me, I shall have done with you for ever.
I come back to my father’s house as an outcast and
a reprobate. Fathers don’t kill their fatted calves
nowadays for prodigal sons. I want no one’s help,
I want no one’s pity but yours, Lucille, for I believe
you are the only creature in this world who loves
me.” This touched me to the heart. What could
I refuse him after that? I told him to wait in the
summer-house till all was safe, and that I would
come for him as soon as I could venture to do so. I
went in and went straight up-stairs to the attic floor,
where I dragged that old bedstead into the most
comfortable room, and carried up blankets from down-stairs.
I lighted a fire, for the room felt damp, and
made all as decent as I could. By the time I had
done this, the Winchers had gone to bed; and I unbolted
the door of the brewery as quietly as I could—but
it is a long way from the room where they used
to sleep, as you know, so there was very little fear
of their hearing me—and went to the summer-house
to fetch my father. We crept slowly past the Winchers’
room and up the stairs, for I was afraid of
grandpapa’s quick ear, even at that hour. When I
showed my father the room I had chosen for him, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
objected to it, and asked to see the other rooms on
this floor, which I had told him were entirely unoccupied.
He selected the room at the north end of
the house.’</p>

<p>‘Of course,’ thought Lucius; ‘he had been informed
about the secret staircase!’</p>

<p>‘I told him that this room was exactly over my
grandfather’s, and that he couldn’t make a worse
choice if he didn’t want to be heard. “I’ll take
care,” he said; “I can walk as softly as a cat when
I like. The other rooms are all damp.” He carried
the bedstead and an old table and chair into
this room, lit a fire, taking great care to make no
noise, and made himself tolerably comfortable, while
I went down-stairs to get what provisions I could
out of our scantily-furnished larder. After this he
came and went as he liked; sometimes he would
sleep away whole days, sometimes he would be absent
three or four days at a time. I had to let him
out at night or let him in, just as he pleased; sometimes
I sat up all night waiting for him. When he
was away I had to keep a candle burning in one of
the back windows on the top floor, to show that all
was safe if he wanted to return. I cannot tell you
the anxiety I suffered all through this time. The
power of sleep seemed to leave me altogether. Even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
when I did not expect my father’s return, I was
always listening for his signal—a handful of gravel
thrown up against the window of my room. I knew
that I was doing wrong, and yet could not feel sorry
that I had granted his request. It seemed such a
small thing to give my father an empty garret in
this great desolate house. So things went on till
the day when you and I were in the loft together;
and when you saw the door of my father’s room
opened and shut. You can guess what I suffered
then, Lucius.’</p>

<p>‘Poor child, poor child!’ he murmured tenderly.</p>

<p>‘And then came the day when you—No, I
can’t speak of it any more, Lucius. All that followed
that time is too dreadful. I woke up to the knowledge
that my father had tried to—murder—’ The
words came slowly, stifled with sobs, and once more
Lucille broke down altogether.</p>

<p>‘Not another word, darling,’ cried her lover.
‘You have no reason to reproach yourself. When
you admitted Ferdinand Sivewright to this house,
you only obeyed the natural impulse of a woman’s
tender heart. Had the most fatal result followed
that man’s baneful presence no blame could have
attached to you; and now, dearest, listen to me.
Brief as my absence will be, I don’t mean to leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
you here while I am away. You have had enough of
this house for the present. This faithful heart has
been too much tried—this active brain too severely
tasked. As your medical adviser, I order change of
air and scene. As your future husband, I insist upon
being obeyed.’</p>

<p>‘Leave poor grandpapa! Impossible, Lucius.’</p>

<p>‘Poor grandpapa shall be reconciled to your departure.
He is going on very well, and is in excellent
hands. Nurse Milderson is as true as steel.
Besides, you are not going to be absent long, Lucille.
I shall take you away to-morrow morning, and bring
you back again, God willing, a week hence.’</p>

<p>‘Take me away! Where, Lucius?’</p>

<p>‘To my sister Janet.’</p>

<p>He had spoken of this sister to his betrothed of
late; rarely, but with a quiet affection which Lucille
knew to be deep.</p>

<p>The pale face flushed with a bright happy look at
this suggestion.</p>

<p>‘I am to go to see your sister, Lucius!’ she cried.
‘I should like that of all things.’</p>

<p>‘I thought so, darling. Janet is staying in a
little rustic village in my part of the country. I had
a letter from her a week ago, telling me of her change
of residence. She is with an old woman who was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
our nurse when we were little ones; so if you want to
hear what an ill-conditioned refractory imp Master
Lucius Davoren was in an early stage of his existence,
you may receive the information from the fountain-head.’</p>

<p>Lucille smiled through the tears that were hardly
dry yet. Everything relating to lovers is interesting—to
themselves.</p>

<p>‘I daresay you were a very good boy, Lucius,’
she said, ‘and that your old nurse will do nothing
but praise you. I shall be so pleased to see your
sister, and the place where you were born—if grandpapa
will only let me go.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll get his permission, dearest. Be assured of
that.’</p>

<p>‘And do you think your sister will like me—a
little? I know I shall love her.’</p>

<p>‘The love will be mutual, depend upon it, darling.
And now I think I’d better go up-stairs to Mr. Sivewright
and talk to him about your holiday.’</p>

<p>‘My holiday!’ cried Lucille. ‘How strange that
sounds! I have not spent a day away from this
house since I came home from school three years
ago.’</p>

<p>‘No wonder such imprisonment has paled my
fair young blossom,’ said her lover tenderly. ‘Hampshire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
breezes will bring back the roses to my darling’s
cheeks.’</p>

<p>He left her to propose this somewhat daring scheme
to Mr. Sivewright, over whom he felt he had acquired
some slight influence. In all his talk with Lucille
to-night—which had taken a turn he had in no manner
anticipated—he had not asked those questions
he wished to ask about her life before the Bond-street
period. It did not very much matter, he thought.
Those questions could stand over till to-morrow. But
before he started for Rouen he wanted to fortify his
case with all the information Lucille’s memory could
afford him.</p>

<p>‘And the recollections of earliest childhood are
sometimes very clear,’ he said to himself, as he went
up the dark staircase to his interview with Homer
Sivewright.</p>

<p>The old man granted his request more readily
than Lucius had expected. Lucille’s illness had served
as a rousing shock for the selfishness of age. Mr.
Sivewright had awakened to the reflection that this
gentle girl, who had ministered to him with such
patience and tenderness, and had received such small
requital for her love, was very necessary to his comfort,
and that even his dim gray life would be darkened,
were relentless Death to snatch her away, leaving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
him to end his journey alone. He had hitherto
thought of her as young and strong, and in a manner
warranted to live and thrive even under the least
favourable circumstances. His eyes were opened
now. The change which illness had wrought in her
had impressed him painfully. For once in his life
he felt the sharp sting of self-reproach.</p>

<p>‘Yes, let her go by all means,’ he said, when
Lucius had told him his plan. ‘I daresay your
sister’s a very nice person, and of course Lucille
ought to make the acquaintance of your relations.
She has need of friends, poor child, for it would be
difficult to find any one more alone in the world than
she is. Yes, let her go. But you’ll not keep her
away long, eh, Davoren? I shall miss her sorely.
I never knew that her absence could make much
difference in my life, seeing how little sympathy there
is between us, until the other day when she was ill.’</p>

<p>‘She shall not be away from you more than a
week,’ answered Lucius. ‘She was strongly opposed
to the idea of leaving you at all, and only
yielded to my insistence.’</p>

<p>He then proceeded to inform Mr. Sivewright of
his intended journey to Rouen. The old man seemed
more than doubtful of success; but did not endeavour
to throw cold water on the scheme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>‘It’s a tangled skein,’ he said; ‘if you can
straighten it you’ll do a clever thing. I should certainly
like to know the history of that child’s birth;
yet it will cost me a pang if I find there is no blood
of mine in her veins.’</p>

<p>Thus they parted, Homer Sivewright perfectly
reconciled to the idea of being left to the care of
Mrs. Milderson and the Magsbys. Lucius felt that
justice demanded Mr. and Mrs. Wincher should be
speedily reinstated, and all stain removed from their
escutcheon. Yet, ere he could do this, he must tell
Mr. Sivewright the true story of the robbery, and of
his son’s return; a story which would be difficult
for Lucius to tell, and which might occasion more
agitation than the old man, in his present condition,
could well bear.</p>

<p>‘Let time and care complete his cure,’ thought
Lucius, ‘and then I will tell him all.’</p>

<p>He arranged the hour of starting with Lucille,
after due consultation of the South-Western timetable,
which Mrs. Magsby fetched for him from the
nearest stationer’s. There was a train from Waterloo
at a quarter-past nine.</p>

<p>‘I shall come for you in a cab at a quarter-past
eight,’ said Lucius decisively.</p>

<p>‘Bless your dear hearts!’ exclaimed Mrs. Milderson,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
in a burst of enthusiasm. ‘It seems for all
the world as if you was a-planning of your honeymoon;
and I do think as how a fortnight in a quiet
place in the country, where you can get your new
potatoes and summer cabbages fresh out of the garden,
and a new-laid egg and a drop of rich cream for
your breakfasts, is better than all your rubbiging
‘To Paris and back for five pounds,’ which Mrs. Binks
went when she and Binks was married, and was that
ill with the cookery at the cheap restorers—everythink
fried in ile, and pea-soup that stodgy you could
cut it with a knife, and cold sparrowgrass with ile
and vinegar—and the smells of them drains, as if
everybody in the place had been emptying cabbage-water,
as her life was a burding to her.’</p>

<p>‘We’re not quite ready for our honeymoon yet,
nurse,’ answered Lucius; ‘but depend upon it, when
that happy time does come, we won’t patronise Paris
and the cheap restaurants. We’ll find some tranquil
corner in this busy world, almost as remote from the
haunts of man as the mountains of the moon.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Milderson charged herself with the responsibility
of packing Lucille’s portmanteau that night,
though the girl declared herself quite equal to the
task.</p>

<p>‘I won’t have you worritin’ and stoopin’ over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
boxes and pulling out drawers,’ said the nurse;
‘everythink shall be ready to the moment; and if I
forget so much as a hairpin, you may say the unkindest
things you can to me when you come back.’</p>

<p>Having settled everything entirely to his own
satisfaction, Lucius departed, after a tender farewell
which was to last only till to-morrow. He looked
forward to this first journey with his betrothed with
an almost childish delight. Only two or three hours’
swift transit through green fields, and past narrow
patches of woodland, chalky hills, rustic villages,
nameless streams winding between willow-shaded
banks, white high-roads leading heaven knows where:
but, with Lucille, such a journey would be two or
three hours in paradise. And then what a joy to
bring those two together—those two women whom
alone, of all earth’s womankind, he fondly loved!</p>

<p>The clocks were striking ten as he left Cedar
House, after impressing upon Lucille the necessity
for a long night’s rest. His homeward way would
take him very near that humble alley in which Mr.
and Mrs. Wincher had found a shelter for their
troubles. He remembered this, and resolved to pay
them a visit to-night, late as it was, in order to tell
Mr. Wincher that he stood acquitted of any wrong
against his master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>‘I was quick enough to suspect and to accuse
them,’ thought Lucius; ‘let me be as quick to acknowledge
my error.’</p>

<p>Crown-and-Anchor-court was still astir when
Lucius entered its modest shades. It was the hour
of supper beer, and small girls in pinafores, who, from
a sanitary point of view, ought to have been in bed
hours before, were trotting to and fro with large
crockeryware jugs, various in colour and design, but
bearing a family likeness in dilapidation, not one
being intact as to spout and handle. There were
farther indications of the evening meal in an appetising
odour of fried onions, a floating aroma of
bloaters, faint breathings of stewed tripe, and even
whispers of pork-chops. The day may have gone ill
with the Crown-and-Anchorites, and dinners may
have run short, but the heads of the household made
it up at night with some toothsome dish when the
children—except always the useful errand-going eldest
daughter—were snug in bed, and there were fewer
mouths to be filled with the choice morsel.</p>

<p>A light twinkled in Mr. Wincher’s parlour, but
he and his good lady had sought no consolation from
creature-comforts. A fragment of hardest Dutch
cheese and the heel of a stale half-quartern alone
adorned their melancholy board. Mrs. Wincher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
sat with her elbows on the table, in a contemplative
mood; Mr. Wincher came to the door chumping his
dry fare industriously.</p>

<p>‘My good people,’ said Lucius, coming straight
to the point, ‘I have come to beg your forgiveness
for a great wrong. I have only this night discovered
the actual truth.’</p>

<p>‘You have found the property, sir?’ cried Mr.
Wincher, trembling a little from very joy, and making
a sudden bolt of his unsavoury mouthful.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wincher gave a shrill scream, followed by
a shriller laugh, indicative of that most troublesome
of feminine ailments, hysteria. Lucius knew the
symptoms but too well. His lady-patients in the
Shadrack-road were, as a rule, hysterical. They
‘went off,’ as they called it, on the smallest provocation.
Their joys and sorrows expressed themselves
in hysteria; their quarrels ended in hysteria; they
were hysterical at weddings, christenings, and funerals;
and they prided themselves on the weakness.</p>

<p>After having tried all remedies suggested by the
highest authorities upon this particular form of
disease, Lucius had found that the most efficacious
treatment was one ignored by the faculty. This
simple mode of cure was to take no notice of the
patient. He took no notice of Mrs. Wincher’s premonitory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
symptoms; and instead of ‘going off,’ that
lady ‘came to.’</p>

<p>‘No, Mr. Wincher,’ he said, in answer to the old
man’s eager question, ‘the property has not been recovered—never
will be, I should think; but I am
tolerably satisfied as to the thief, and I know you are
not the man.’</p>

<p>‘Thank God, sir—thank God!’ cried Mr. Wincher
devoutly. ‘I am very thankful. I couldn’t
have died easy while you and my old master thought
me a thief and a liar.’</p>

<p>The tears rolled down Mr. Wincher’s wrinkled
cheek. He dropped feebly into his chair, and wiped
those joyful tears with a corner of the threadbare
tablecloth.</p>

<p>‘I wouldn’t be so wanting to my own self in
proper pride, Wincher,’ said his wife, who was not
disposed to forgive Lucius at a moment’s warning.
Had she not liked and praised him and smiled benignantly
on his wooing, and had he not turned
upon her like the scorpion? ‘We had the conscientiousness
of our own innocence to support us, and
with that I could have gone to Newgate without
blinching. It’s all very well to come here, Dr. Davory,
and demean yourself by astin’ our pardings; but
you can’t make up to us for the suffering we’ve gone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
through along of your unjust suspicions,’ added Mrs.
Wincher, somewhat inconsistently.</p>

<p>Lucius expressed his regret with supreme humility.</p>

<p>‘If ever I am a rich man,’ he said, ‘I will try to
atone for my mistake in some more substantial manner.
In the mean time you must accept this trifle
as a proof of my sincerity.’</p>

<p>He pressed a five-pound note upon Mr. Wincher—a
poor solatium for the wrong done, but a large
sum for the parish doctor to give away, on the eve of
an undertaking which was likely to be expensive.</p>

<p>‘No, sir—not a farthing,’ said Mr. Wincher resolutely.
‘You offered me money before, and it was
kindly done, for you thought me a scoundrel, and
you didn’t want even a scoundrel to starve. I appreciate
the kindness of your offer to-night, but I won’t
take a farthing. We shall rub on somehow, I make
no doubt, though the world does seem a little overcrowded.
You’ve acknowledged the wrong you did
me, Mr. Davoren, and that’s more than enough.’</p>

<p>Lucius pressed the money upon him, but in vain.</p>

<p>‘Do you find life so prosperous, and work so
plentiful, that you refuse a friendly offer?’ he asked
at last.</p>

<p>‘Well, not exactly, sir,’ replied Mr. Wincher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
with a sigh. ‘I do get an odd job now and then, it’s
true, but the now and then are very far apart.’</p>

<p>‘And you find it hard to pay the rent of this
room and live without trenching on your little
fund?’</p>

<p>‘Sir, our savings are melting day by day; but we
are old; and, after all, better people than we are have
had to end their days in a workhouse. There’s no
reproach in such an end if one has worked one’s
hardest all the days of one’s life.’</p>

<p>‘You shall not be reduced to the workhouse if I
can help it, Mr. Wincher,’ said Lucius heartily. ‘If
you are too proud to take money from me—’</p>

<p>‘No, sir, not too proud; it isn’t pride, but principle.’</p>

<p>‘If you won’t take my money, Mr. Wincher, I
must try to find you a home. Come and live with
me. My housekeeper has given me a good deal of
trouble lately; in fact, I’m afraid she’s not so temperate
in her habits as she ought to be, and I sha’n’t
be sorry to get rid of her. I am not in a position to
offer you very liberal wages—’</p>

<p>‘Bless your heart, sir, we’ve not been accustomed
to wages of late years. “Stay with me if you like,”
said Mr. Sivewright, “but I’m too poor to pay wages.
I’ll give you a roof to cover you, and a trifle for your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
board.” And we contrived to live upon the trifle,
sir, by cutting it rather fine.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll give you what I give my present housekeeper,’
answered Lucius, ‘and you must manage to
rub on upon it till my prospects improve. I think
you’ll be able to make my house comfortable—eh,
Mrs. Wincher?—and to get on with its new mistress,
when I am happy enough to bring my wife home.’</p>

<p>‘Lor, sir, I can do for you better than I did for
Mr. Sivewright, who’s a deal more troublesomer than
ever you could be, even if you tried to give trouble;
and as to Miss Lucille, why, she knows I’d wear the
flesh off my bones to serve her, willing.’</p>

<p>It was all settled satisfactorily. Lucius was to
give his housekeeper a week’s notice, as per agreement.
She had burnt his chop and smoked his tea
continually of late, despite his remonstrances. And
Mr. and Mrs. Wincher were to take up their abode
with him as soon as he returned from his foreign
expedition. They parted on excellent terms with each
other.</p>

<span class="fs70">LUCILLE MAKES A NEW FRIEND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> sun shone on the lovers’ journey. It was almost
the happiest day in the lives of either; certainly
the happiest day these two had ever spent together.
To Lucille, after perpetual imprisonment in the
Shadrack-road, those green fields and autumnal
woods seemed unutterably beautiful—the winding
river—the changing shadows on the hill-side—the
villages nestling in verdant hollows.</p>

<p>‘How can any one live in London!’ she exclaimed,
with natural wonder, the only London she
knew being so dreary and dingy a scene.</p>

<p>The judicious administration of half-a-crown on
Lucius’s part had procured the lovers a compartment
to themselves. He was anxious to ask those questions
which he had meant to ask last night, when
the conversation had taken so unexpected a turn.</p>

<p>‘Lucille,’ he began, plunging at once to the heart
of his subject, ‘I want you to grant that request I
made last night. I am not going to speak of Ferdinand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
Sivewright; put him out of your thoughts altogether,
as some one who has no further influence
upon your fate. I want you to tell me your first
impressions of life, before you went to Bond-street.
Forgive me, dearest, if I ask you to recall memories
that may pain you. I have a strong reason for wishing
you to answer me.’</p>

<p>‘You might tell me the reason, Lucius.’</p>

<p>‘I will tell you some day.’</p>

<p>‘I suppose I must be content with that,’ she
said; and then went on thoughtfully, ‘My first memories,
my first impressions? I think my first recollection
is of the sea.’</p>

<p>‘You lived within sight of the sea, then?’</p>

<p>‘Yes. I can just remember—almost as faintly
as if it were a dream—being lifted up in my nurse’s
arms, in an orchard on a hill, to look at the sea.
There it lay before us, wide and blue and bright. I
wanted to fly to it.’</p>

<p>‘Can you remember your nurse?’</p>

<p>‘I know she wore a high white cap and no bonnet,
and spoke a language that I never heard after I came
to Bond-street—a language with a curious twang.
I daresay it was some French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">patois</i>.’</p>

<p>‘Very likely. And your mother, Lucille? Have
you no recollection of her?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>‘No recollection!’ cried the girl, her eyes filling
with tears. ‘Why, I have cherished the memory of
her face all my life; it was something too sacred to
speak of, even to you. She is the sweetest memory
of those happy days—a face that bent over my bed
every morning when I awoke—a face that watched
me every night when I fell asleep; and I never remember
falling asleep except in her arms. It is all
dim and dreamlike now, but so sweet, so sweet!’</p>

<p>‘Is that anything like the face?’ asked Lucius,
showing her the miniature.</p>

<p>‘Yes, it is the very face!’ she cried, tearfully kissing
it. ‘Where did you get this portrait, Lucius?’</p>

<p>‘Your grandfather gave it me.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I remember his showing me this miniature
a long time ago. But of late he has refused to let
me see it.’</p>

<p>‘He may have feared to awaken sorrowful memories.’</p>

<p>‘As if they had ever slept. Will you give me
this picture, Lucius?’</p>

<p>‘Not yet, dearest. I have a reason for wishing
to retain it a little while longer; but I fully recognise
your right to possess it.’</p>

<p>‘It is a double miniature,’ said Lucille, turning
it round. ‘Whose is the other portrait?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>‘Have you no recollection of that face?’</p>

<p>‘No; I can recall no face but my mother’s—not
even my nurse’s. I only remember her tall white
cap, and her big rough hands.’</p>

<p>‘You remember no gentleman in that home by
the sea?’</p>

<p>‘Not distinctly. There was some one who was
always taking mamma out in a carriage, leaving me
to cry for her. That gentleman must have been my
father, I suppose, yet my vague recollection of the
face seems different. I remember being told to kiss
him one night, and refusing because he always took
mamma away from me.’</p>

<p>‘Were you happy?’</p>

<p>‘O yes, very happy, though I cried when mamma
left me. My nurse was kind. I remember long
sunny days in the orchard on that hill, with the
bright blue sea before us, and a house with a thatched
verandah, and a parlour full of all kinds of pretty
things—boxes and baskets and picture-books—and
mamma’s guitar. She used to sing every night to
the accompaniment of the guitar. We lived near
the top of a high hill—very high and steep—higher
than any hills we have passed to-day.’</p>

<p>‘Is that all you can tell me, Lucille?’</p>

<p>‘I think so. The life seemed to melt away like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
a dream. I can’t remember the end of it. If my
mother died in that house on the hill, I can remember
no circumstance connected with her death—no illness,
no funeral. My last recollection of her is being
clasped in her arms—feeling her tears and kisses
on my face. Then came a long, long journey with
my father. I was very tired, but he was kind to me,
and held me in his arms while I slept; and one
morning I woke to find myself in the gloomy-looking
bedroom in Bond-street. I began to cry, and Mrs.
Wincher came to me; and soon after that some one
told me that my mother was dead. I think it was
grandpapa.’</p>

<p>‘Poor child! poor lonely deserted child!’ said
Lucius.</p>

<p>‘Not deserted, Lucius. My mother would never
have abandoned me while she lived.’</p>

<p>‘Enough, dearest! You have told me much
that may help me to a discovery I am anxious to
make.’</p>

<p>‘What discovery?’</p>

<p>‘I must ask you to be patient, dear. You shall
know all before long.’</p>

<p>‘I have had some practice in patience, Lucius,
and to-day I am too happy to complain. Do you
think your sister will like me?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>‘It is not possible she can do otherwise. I
sent her a telegram this morning telling her to expect
us.’</p>

<p>‘She will be at the station to meet us, perhaps,’
said Lucille with an alarmed look.</p>

<p>‘It is just possible that she may.’</p>

<p>‘O Lucius, I begin to feel nervous. Is your
sister a person who takes violent likings and dislikings
at first sight?’</p>

<p>‘No, dear. My sister has some claim to be considered
sensible.’</p>

<p>‘But she is not dreadfully sensible, I hope; for
in that case she might think me foolish and emptyheaded.’</p>

<p>‘I will answer for her thinking no such thing.’</p>

<p>‘Can you really, Lucius? But is she like you?’</p>

<p>‘She is much better-looking than I am.’</p>

<p>‘As if that were possible,’ said Lucille archly.</p>

<p>‘In your eyes of course it is not.’</p>

<p>‘Mrs. Bertram is a widow, is she not?’ asked
Lucille. ‘Pray don’t think me inquisitive; only
you have told me so little, and I might make some
awkward mistake in talking to your sister.’</p>

<p>‘She is not a widow; but she is separated from
her husband, who is a scoundrel.’</p>

<p>‘I am so sorry.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>‘Yes, dear; her life, since girlhood, has been a
sad one. She made that one fatal mistake by which
a woman can mar her existence—an unhappy marriage.’</p>

<p>‘I shall be careful never to mention Mr. Bertram.
Indeed, we shall have an inexhaustible subject of
conversation in you.’</p>

<p>‘You will soon wear that topic threadbare. After
all, there is not often much interest in the childhood
of great men. Here we are at the station.’</p>

<p>‘How short the journey has seemed!’ said Lucille.</p>

<p>‘And yet we have been three hours on the road.
Think of it as typical of our life journey, dearest,
which will seem only too brief if we but travel together.’</p>

<p>The station was the most insignificant place in
the world; yet all the great folks who went to
Mardenholme had to alight here. Foxley-road was
the name of the station, but Foxley itself was a long
way off, so far that the designation seemed intended
to deceive. There was a stunted omnibus to meet
the train, labelled Mardenholme and Foxley—Foxley
was the name of that obscure spot where
Geoffrey Hossack had found his lost love—but
not in the stunted omnibus was Lucille to travel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
to her destination. Janet and Janet’s little girl
were there to meet her in a wagonette borrowed
for the occasion, and driven by an ancient man in
knee-breeches, whose garments, though clean and
tidy, diffused a faint odour of pigs.</p>

<p>Before Lucille had time to wonder how Janet
would receive her, she found herself in Janet’s
arms.</p>

<p>‘I am prepared to love you very dearly, for my
brother’s sake and for your own,’ said Janet with a
calm protecting air, kissing the poor little pale face.
‘I thought you’d like me to be here to meet you
and Lucille, Lucius; so I borrowed a neighbour’s
wagonette and a neighbour’s coachman.’</p>

<p>The piggy man grinned at the allusion. It was
not often society dignified him with the name of
coachman; and he knew that his master returned
him in the tax-paper as an out-of-door labourer.</p>

<p>Little Flossie was next kissed and admired, and
introduced to her future aunt.</p>

<p>‘May I call you aunt Lucille, at once?’ she asked.</p>

<p>‘Of course you may, darling.’</p>

<p>Lucille’s portmanteau was deposited by the side
of the piggy man, and they all mounted the wagonette,
and drove off through lanes still gay with wild
flowers and rich with balmy odours even in the very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
death of summer. Lucille was delighted with everything.</p>

<p>‘You can’t imagine what a quiet corner of the
earth you are coming to,’ said Janet. ‘I’m afraid
you’ll find it very dull.’</p>

<p>‘Not duller than Cedar House,’ interjected Lucius.</p>

<p>‘And that you’ll soon grow tired of the place and
of me.’</p>

<p>‘Dull with you! tired of you!’ exclaimed Lucille,
putting her little hand into Janet’s, ‘when I
have been longing to know you.’</p>

<p>Half-an-hour’s drive in the jolting old wagonette
brought them to Foxley, the cluster of thatched
cottages in the green hollow where Geoffrey had
discovered his lost love. Dahlias now bloomed in
gaudy variety to extinguish the few pale roses that
lingered behind their mates of the garden, like dissipated
young beauties who stay latest at a ball. There
were even here and there early blooming china-asters,
and the Virginian creeper glowed redly on some cottage
walls. Yet, despite these evidences of advancing
autumn, the spot was hardly less fair than when
Geoffrey had first seen it. There was that air of
repose about the scene, that soothing influence of
placid dispassionate nature, which is almost sweeter
than actual beauty. No wide glory of landscape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
made the traveller exclaim, no vast and various amphitheatre
of wood and hill startled him into wondering
admiration; but the settled peacefulness of
the scene crept into his heart, and comforted his
griefs.</p>

<p>To the eyes of Lucille, fresh from the grimy barrenness
of the Cedar House garden, the spot seemed
simply exquisite. What a perfume of clove carnations
in the garden! what a sweet scent of lavender
in the little white-curtained bedroom! And then how
genial the welcome of the old nurse, with her benevolent-looking
mob-cap and starched white apron;
and what an interesting personage she appeared to
Lucille!</p>

<p>‘And you really remember Mr. Davoren when he
was quite a little boy?’ said Lucille, as the dame
waited on her while she took off her bonnet.</p>

<p>‘Remember him! I should think I did indeed,
miss,’ exclaimed the dame. ‘I remember him so well
as a boy, that it’s as much as I can do to believe
he can have growed into a man. “Can it really be
him,” I says to myself when I sees him come in
at that gate just now, “him as I remember in holland
pinafores, two fresh ones every day, and never
clean half an hour after they were put on?”’</p>

<p>‘Did he make his pinafores very dirty?’ asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
Lucille with a slight revulsion of feeling. Lucius
ought to have been an ideal boy, and spotless as to
his pinafores.</p>

<p>‘There never was such a pickle, miss; but so
kind and loving with it all, and so bold and open.
Never no fibbing with him. And many a pound
he’s sent me since I’ve lived here; though I don’t
suppose he’s got too many of ’em for hisself, bless
his kind heart.’</p>

<p>Lucille rewarded the lips that praised her lover
with a kiss.</p>

<p>‘What a dear good soul you are!’ she said. ‘I’m
so happy to have come here.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, you’ll be happy with our Miss Janet,
begging her pardon; but, never having seen Mr.
Bertram, I haven’t got him in my mind like when
I think of her. You’re sure to take to Miss Janet.
She’s a little proud and high in her ways to strangers,
but she has as good a heart as her brother.’</p>

<p>A nice little dinner had been prepared for the
travellers. Lucius would have only just time to
dine, and then return to the station, in order to be
back in time for the Newhaven train from London-Bridge. 
It would be a hard day’s work for him
altogether; but what was that when weighed against
the pleasure of having brought these two together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
thus—the sister he loved and had once deemed lost,
and the girl who was to be his wife.</p>

<p>The parting cost them all a pang, though he
promised to come back in a week, if all went well
with him, and fetch Lucille.</p>

<p>‘I could not stay away from my grandfather
longer than that, Lucius,’ she said; ‘and,’ in a
lower tone, ‘it will seem a very long time to be
separated from you.’</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was still quite early in the day when Lucius
entered Rouen, but the bustle of commerce had begun
upon the quays. Shrill voices bawled to each
other among the shipping, and it seemed as if a
small slice of the West India Docks had been transferred
to this bluer stream. The bustle of business
here was a very small matter compared with the
press and clamour of the Shadrack-Basin district.
Still the town had a prosperous progressive air. Lofty
stone-fronted mansions and lofty stone-fronted warehouses
glared whitely in the sunshine, some finished
and occupied, but more in process of construction.
This mushroom growth of modern commerce seemed
to have risen all at once, to overshadow the quaint
old city where the warrior-maid was martyred. Lucius,
who had not seen the place for some years,
looked round him aghast. This broad lime-white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
boulevard, these tall lime-white buildings, were as
new as Aladdin’s palace.</p>

<p>‘What has become of <em>my</em> Rouen?’ he asked himself
dejectedly. The city had pleased him five years
ago, when he and Geoffrey passed through it during
a long-vacation excursion, but the queer old gabled
houses, older than the Fronde—nay, many of them
ancient as the famous Joan herself—the archways,
the curious nooks and corners, the narrow streets
and inconvenient footways, in a word, all that had
made the city at once delightful to the tourist and
unwholesome for its inhabitants, seemed to be extinguished
by those new boulevards and huge houses.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour’s exploration, however,
showed Lucius that much that was interesting in
<em>his</em> Rouen still remained. There was the narrow
street with its famous sweetmeat shops, once the
chief thoroughfare; yonder the noble old cathedral;
there St. Ouen, that grandest and purest of Gothic
churches. Modern improvement had not touched
these, save to renovate their olden splendour.</p>

<p>The traveller did not even stop to refresh himself,
but went straight to the Rue Jeanne d’Arques,
a narrow quiet street in an out-of-the-way corner,
behind the Palais de Justice; so quiet, indeed, that
it was difficult to imagine, in the gray stillness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
this retreat, that the busy, prosperous, Napoleonised
city was near at hand.</p>

<p>The street was as clean as it was dull, and had a
peculiar neatness of aspect, which is, as it were, the
seal of respectability. A large white Angora cat
purred upon one of the doorsteps—a canary chirped
in an open window—a pair of mirrors attached to
the sides of another casement, in the Belgian fashion,
denoted that there were some observing eyes which
did not deem even the scanty traffic of the Rue Jeanne
d’Arques beneath their notice. Most of the houses
were in private occupation, but there were two or
three shops—one a lace-shop, another a watchmaker’s,
and the watchmaker’s was next door to
Number 17.</p>

<p>Lucius crossed to the opposite side of the way and
inspected this Number 17—the house from which
Madame Dumarques, Lucille’s mother, had written
to Ferdinand Sivewright. It had no originality in
its physiognomy. Like the rest of the houses in the
street, it was dull and clean—like them it looked
eminently respectable. It inspired no curiosity in
the observer—it suggested no mystery hidden among
its inhabitants.</p>

<p>Should he pull that brightly-polished brass knob
and summon the porter or portress, and ask to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
the present inmates of Number 17? There might be
two or three different families in the house, though
it was not large. His eye wandered to the watchmaker’s
next door. A shop is neutral ground, and
a watchmaker’s trade is leisurely, and inclines its
practitioners to a mild indulgence in gossiping. The
watchmaker would in all probability know a good
deal about Number 17, its occupants past and present.</p>

<p>Lucius recrossed the street and entered the watchmaker’s
shop. He was pleased to find that mechanician
seated before the window examining the intestines
of a chronometer through a magnifying glass,
but with no appearance of being pressed for time. He
was old and gray and small, with a patient expression
which promised good nature even towards a stranger.</p>

<p>Lucius gave a conciliatory cough and wished him
good-morning, a salutation which the watchmaker
returned with brisk politeness. He gave a sigh of
relief and laid down the chronometer; as if he were
rather glad to be done with it for a little while.</p>

<p>‘I regret to say that I do not come as a customer,’
said Lucius. The watchmaker shrugged his shoulders
and smiled, as who should say, ‘Fate does not
always favour me.’ ‘I come rather to ask your kindly
assistance in my search for information about some
people who may be dead long ago, for anything I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
know to the contrary. Have you lived any length
of time in this street, sir?’</p>

<p>‘I have lived in this street all the time that I have
lived at all, sir,’ replied the watchmaker. ‘I was
born in this house, and my father was born here before
me. There is a little notch in yonder door
which indicates my height at five years old; my
father cut it in all the pride of a paternal heart, my
mother looking on with maternal love. My aftergrowth
did not realise the promise of that period.’</p>

<p>Lucius tried to look interested in this small domestic
episode, but failed somewhat in the endeavour;
so eager was he to question the watchmaker about
the subject he had at heart.</p>

<p>‘Did you ever hear the name of Dumarques in
this street?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘Did I ever hear my own name?’ exclaimed the
watchmaker. ‘One is not more familiar to me than
the other. You mean the Dumarques who lived next
door.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes—are they there still?’</p>

<p>‘They! They are dead. It is not every one who
lives to the age of Voltaire.’</p>

<p>‘Are they all dead?’ asked Lucius, disheartened.
It seemed strange that an entire family should be
swept away within fifteen years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>‘Well, no; I believe Julie Dumarques is still
living. But she left Rouen some years ago.’</p>

<p>‘Do you know where she has gone?’</p>

<p>‘She went to Paris; but as to her address in
Paris—no, I do not know that. But if it be vital
to you to learn it—’</p>

<p>‘It is vital to me.’</p>

<p>‘I might possibly put you in the way of obtaining
the information, or procure it for you.’</p>

<p>‘I shall be most grateful if you can do me that
favour. Any trifling recompense which I can offer
you—’</p>

<p>‘Sir, I require no reward beyond the consciousness
of having performed a worthy action. I am a
disciple of Jean Jacques Rousseau; I live entirely
on vegetable diet; and I endeavour to assist my fellow creatures.’</p>

<p>‘I thank you, sir, for your disinterested kindness.
And now perhaps you will lay me under a
farther obligation by telling me all you can about
these neighbours of yours?’</p>

<p>‘Willingly, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Were they tradespeople, or what, these Dumarques?’</p>

<p>‘Wait a little, sir, and I will tell you everything,’
said Monsieur Gastin, the little watchmaker. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
ushered Lucius into a neat little sitting-room, which
was evidently also his bedchamber, installed him in
an arm-chair covered with bright yellow-velvet, took
a second yellow-velvet chair for himself, clasped his
bony hands upon his angular knee, and began his
story. Through the half-glass door he commanded
an admirable view of his shop, and was ready to
spring up at any moment, should a customer invite
his attention.</p>

<p>‘Old André Dumarques, the father, had been in
the cotton trade, when the cotton trade, like almost
every other trade, was a great deal better than it is
now. He had made a little money—not very much,
but just enough to afford him, when judiciously invested,
an income that he could manage to live upon.
Another man with a family like his might not have
been able to live upon André Dumarques’ income;
but he was a man of penurious habits, and could
make five-and-twenty centimes go as far as half a
franc with most people. He had married late in
life, and his wife was a good deal too young and
too pretty for him, and the neighbours did not fail
to talk, as people do talk amongst our lively nation,
about such matters. But Madame Dumarques was
a good woman, and though every one knew pretty
well that hers wasn’t a happy marriage, still no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
name ever came of it. She did her duty, and slaved
herself to death to make both ends meet, and keep
her house neat and clean. Number seventeen was
a model to the rest of the street in those days, I
can assure you.’</p>

<p>‘She slaved herself to death, you say, sir? What
does that mean?’ inquired Lucius.</p>

<p>‘It means that she became <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poitrinaire</i> when her
youngest daughter—she had three daughters, but
no son—was fifteen years old, and as pretty as her
mother at the same age. Everybody had seen the
poor woman fading gradually for the last six years,
except her husband. He saw nothing, till the stamp
of death was on her face, and then he went on like
a madman. He spent his money freely enough then—had
a doctor from Paris even to see her, because
he wouldn’t believe the Rouen doctors when they
told him his wife was past cure—and would have sacrificed
anything to save her; but it was too late. A
little rest and a little pleasure might have lengthened
her life if she’d had it in time; but nothing could
save her now. She died: and I shall never forget
old André’s face when I saw him coming out of his
house the day after her funeral.’</p>

<p>‘He had been fond of her, then?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, in his selfish way. He had treated her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
like a servant, and worse than any servant in a free
country would submit to be treated, and he had expected
her to wear like a machine. He had always
been hard and tyrannical, and his grief, instead of
softening him, changed him for the worse. He made
his children’s home so wretched, that two of his
daughters—Julie and Félicie—went out to service.
Their poor mother had taught them all she
could; for André Dumarques vowed he wouldn’t
waste his money on paying for his daughters to be
made fine ladies. She had been educated at the
Sacré Cœur, and was quite a lady. She taught
them a good deal; but still people said they weren’t
accomplished enough to be governesses, so they got
situations as lady’s-maids, or humble companions,
or something in that way.’</p>

<p>‘Was Félicie the youngest?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, and the prettiest. She was the image of
her mother. The others had too much of the father
in them—thin lips, cold gray eyes, sharp noses. She
was all life and sparkle and prettiness; too pretty to
go out into the world among strangers at sixteen
years old.’</p>

<p>‘Did she begin the world so young?’</p>

<p>‘She did. The neighbours wondered that the
father should let her go. I, who knew him, it may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
be, better than most people, for he made no friends,
ventured to say as much. “That is too pretty a
flower to be planted in a stranger’s garden,” said I.
André Dumarques shrugged his shoulders. “What
would you?” he asked. “My children must work for
their living. I am too poor to keep them in idleness.”
In effect, since his wife’s death Dumarques
had become a miser. He had been always mean. He
had now but one desire; and that was to hoard his
money.’</p>

<p>‘Do you know to whom Félicie went, when she
began the world?’</p>

<p>‘The poor child!—no, not precisely; not as to
name and place. But it was to an English lady she
went—I heard as much as that; for, as I said just
now, Dumarques spoke more freely to me than to
others. An elderly English lady, an invalid, was
passing through Rouen with her brother, also elderly
and English—she a maiden lady, he a bachelor. The
lady’s maid had fallen ill on the journey. They had
been travelling in Italy, Switzerland, heaven knows
where, and the lady was in sore want of an attendant;
but she would have no common person, no
peasant girl who talked loud and ate garlic; she
must have a young person of some refinement, conversable—in
brief, almost a lady. Her brother applied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
to the master of the hotel. The master of the
hotel knew something of André Dumarques, and
knew that he wanted to find situations for his daughters.
“I have the very thing at the ends of my
fingers,” he said, and sent his porter upon the spot
with a note to Monsieur Dumarques, asking him to
bring one of his daughters. Félicie had been pining
ever since her mother’s death. She was most anxious
to leave her home. She accompanied her father to
the hotel. The old lady saw her, was delighted with
her, and engaged her on the spot. That was how
Félicie left Rouen.’</p>

<p>‘Did you ever see her again?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, and how sorely changed! It was at least
six years afterwards; and I had almost forgotten that
poor child’s existence. André Dumarques was dead;
he had died leaving a nice little fortune behind him,—the
fruit of deprivations that must have rendered
his life a burden, poor man,—and his eldest daughter,
Hortense, kept the house. Julie had also gone
into service soon after Félicie left home. Hortense
had kept her father’s house ever since her mother’s
death. She kept it still, though there was now no
father for whom to keep it. She must have been
very lonely, and though the house was a picture of
neatness, it had a melancholy air. Mademoiselle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
Dumarques kept three or four cats, and one old servant
who had been in the family for years; no one
ever remembered her being young, not even I, who
approach the age of my great countryman, Voltaire.’</p>

<p>‘And she came back—Félicie?’ asked Lucius,
somewhat exercised in spirit by the watchmaker’s
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">longueurs</i>.</p>

<p>‘She came back; but, ah, how changed! It was
more like the return of a ghost from the grave than
of that bright creature I remembered six years before.
I have no curiosity about my neighbours;
and though I love my fellow creatures in the abstract,
I rarely trouble myself about particular members
of my race, unless they make some direct appeal
to my sympathy. Thus, had I been left to myself,
I might have remained for an indefinite period unaware
of Félicie’s return. But I have a housekeeper
who has the faults as well as the merits of her sex.
While I devote my leisure to those classic writers
who have rendered my native land illustrious, she,
worthy soul, gives her mind to the soup, and the
affairs of her neighbours. One morning, after an
autumnal night of wind and rain—a night upon
which a humanitarian mind would hardly have refused
shelter to a strange cur—my housekeeper handed
me my omelet and poured out my wine with a more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
important air than usual; and I knew that she was
bursting to tell me something about my neighbours.
The omelet, in the preparation of which she is usually
care itself, was even a trifle burned.’</p>

<p>‘I hope you allowed her to relieve her mind.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir; I indulged the simple creature. You
may hear her at this moment, in the little court without
yonder window, singing as she works, not melodious
but cheerful.’</p>

<p>This was in allusion to a monotonous twanging
noise, something between the Irish bagpipes and a
Jew’s-harp, which broke the placid stillness of the
Rue Jeanne d’Arques.</p>

<p>‘“Well, Margot,” I said in my friendly way,
“what has happened?” She burst forth at once
like a torrent. “Figure to yourself then,” she exclaimed,
“that any one—a human being—would
travel on such a night as last night. You might
have waded ankle deep upon the pavement.” “People
must travel in all weathers, my good Margot,” I
replied philosophically. I had not been obliged to
go out myself during the storm of the preceding
evening, and was therefore able to approach the subject
in a calmly contemplative frame of mind. Margot
shrugged her shoulders, and nodded her head
vehemently, till her earrings jingled again. “But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
a woman, then!” she cried; “a young and beautiful
woman, for instance!” This gave a new interest to the
subject. My philanthropy was at once aroused. “A
young and beautiful woman out in the storm last
night!” I exclaimed. “She applied for shelter here,
perhaps, and you accorded her request, and now fear
that I shall disapprove. Margot, I forgive you. Let
me see this child of misfortune.” I was prepared to
administer consolation to the homeless wanderer, in
the broadly Christian spirit of the divine Jean Jacques
Rousseau; but Margot began to shake her head
with incredible energy, and in effect, after much circumlocution
on her part, for she is of a loquacious
disposition, I obtained the following plain statement
of facts.’</p>

<p>Here the little watchmaker, proud of his happy
knack of rounding a period, looked at Lucius for
admiration; but seeing impatience rather than approval
indicated in his visitor’s countenance, he gave
a brief sigh, inwardly denounced the unsympathetic
temperament of the English generally, coughed,
stretched out his neat little legs upon the yellow-velvet
footstool, stuck his thumbs in the armholes of
his waistcoat, and continued thus:</p>

<p>‘Briefly, sir, Félicie Dumarques had returned.
She had arrived during that pitiless storm in a fiacre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
from the station, with luggage. My housekeeper had
heard the vehicle stop, and had run to the door in
time to see the traveller alight and enter the next
house. She had seen Félicie’s face by the light of
the street-lamp, which, as you may have observed, is
near my door, and she told me how sadly the poor
girl was changed. “She looks as her mother did a
year or two before she died,” said Margot. “Her
cheeks are thin, and there is a feverish spot of colour
on them, and her eyes are too bright. They have
made her work too hard in her situation. She was
evidently not expected last night, for the servant
gave a scream when she saw her, and seemed quite
overcome with surprise. Then Mademoiselle Dumarques
came down, and I saw the sisters embrace.
‘Félicie!’ said Hortense. ‘Thou art like the dead
risen from the grave!’” And then the door shut, and
my housekeeper heard no more.’</p>

<p>‘You saw Félicie yourself, I suppose, afterwards?’</p>

<p>‘Yes. She passed my door now and then; but
rarely, for she seldom went out. Sometimes I used
to run out and speak to her. I had known her from
her cradle, remember, and she had always seemed to
like me in the days when she was bright and gay.
Now she had an air that was at once listless and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
anxious, as if she had no interest in her present life,
but was waiting for something—sometimes hoping,
sometimes fearing, and never happy. She would
speak to me in the old sweet voice that I knew so
well—her mother’s voice; but she rarely smiled,
and if ever she did, the smile was almost sadder than
tears. Every time I saw her I saw a change for the
worse; and I felt that she had begun that journey
we must all take some day, even if we live to the age
of the immortal Voltaire.’</p>

<p>‘Did any one ever come to see her—a gentleman—an
Englishman?’ inquired Lucius.</p>

<p>‘Ah,’ cried the watchmaker, ‘I see you know her
history better than I. Yes, an English gentleman
did visit her. It was nearly a year after her return
that he came, in the middle of summer. He stayed
a week at the hotel, the same to which Félicie went
to see the English lady with whom she left Rouen.
This gentleman used to spend most of his time next
door, and he and Félicie Dumarques drove about in
a hired carriage together to different places in the
neighbourhood, and for the first time since her return
I saw Félicie with a happy look on her face.
But there was the stamp of death there too, clear
and plain enough for any eyes that could read; and
I think the Englishman must have seen it as well as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
I. Margot contrived to find out all that happened
next door. She told me that a grand physician had
come from Paris to see Félicie Dumarques, and had
ordered a new treatment, which was to cure her.
And then I regret to say that Margot, who has a
wicked tongue, began to say injurious things about
our neighbours. I stopped her at once, forbidding
her to utter a word to the discredit of Félicie Dumarques,
and a short time after Margot came
to me once more full of importance, to say that I
was right and Félicie was an honest woman. The
old servant next door had told my housekeeper that
the English gentleman was Félicie’s husband. They
had been married in England, but they were obliged
to keep their marriage a secret, on account of the
Englishman’s uncle, who would disinherit him if he
knew his nephew had married a lady’s-maid; for this
gentleman was nephew of the invalid lady who had
taken Félicie away.’</p>

<p>‘I begin to understand,’ said Lucius, and then,
producing the double miniature, he showed the watchmaker
the two portraits.</p>

<p>‘Is either of those faces familiar to you?’ he
asked.</p>

<p>‘Both of them,’ cried the other. ‘One is a portrait
of Félicie Dumarques, in the prime of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
beauty; the other of the Englishman who came to
visit her.’</p>

<p>‘Did you hear the Englishman’s name?’ inquired
Lucius.</p>

<p>‘Never, though Margot, who does not scruple to
push curiosity to impertinence, asked the direct question
of the old servant next door. She was repulsed
with severity. “I have told you there is a secret,”
said the woman, “and it is one that can in no manner
concern you. Madame” (meaning Félicie) “is
an angel of goodness. And do you think Mademoiselle
Hortense would allow the English gentleman
to come here if all was not right; she who is so
correct in her conduct, and goes to mass every day?”
Even Margot was obliged to be satisfied with this.
Well, sir, the Englishman went away. I saw Félicie
drive home in a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voiture de remise</i>; she had been to
the station to see him off. Great Heaven, I never
beheld so sad a face! “Alas, poor child,” I said to
myself, “all the physicians in Paris will never cure
you, for you are dying of sorrow!” And I was not far
wrong, sir. The poor girl died in less than a month
from that day, and was buried on the hill yonder, by
the chapel of our Lady of Bons Secours.’</p>

<p>‘And her elder sister?’</p>

<p>‘Mademoiselle Hortense? She died two years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
ago, and lies yonder on the hill with the rest of
them.’</p>

<p>‘But one sister remains, you say?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, there is still Mademoiselle Julie. She went
to Paris, to a situation in a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">magasin des modes</i>, I
believe. She was always clever with her needle.’</p>

<p>‘And you think you can procure me her present
address in Paris?’</p>

<p>‘I believe I can, and without much difficulty.
The house next door belongs to Mademoiselle Dumarques.
The present tenants must know her address.’</p>

<p>‘I shall be beyond measure obliged again if you
will obtain it for me.’</p>

<p>‘If you will be kind enough to call again this
evening, I will make the inquiry in the mean time.’</p>

<p>‘I thank you, sir, heartily. You have already
given me some valuable information, which may assist
a most amiable young lady to regain her proper place
in the world.’</p>

<p>The disciple of Jean Jacques declared himself
enraptured at the idea that he had served a fellow
creature.</p>

<p>‘There is one point, however, that I might
ascertain before I leave Rouen,’ said Lucius, ‘and
that is the name of Félicie’s husband. You say he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
stayed at the same hotel at which Félicie had seen
the English lady. Which hotel was it?’</p>

<p>‘The Britannique.’</p>

<p>‘And can you give me the date of Félicie’s interview
with the lady?’</p>

<p>The watchmaker shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>‘I cannot say. The years in our quiet life are so
much alike. Félicie was away about six years.’</p>

<p>‘And I have a letter written by her after her
return—dated. That will give me an approximate
date at any rate. I’ll try the Hôtel Britannique.’</p>

<p>Lucius paused in his passage through the shop to
select some trifling articles from the watchmaker’s
small stock of jewelry which might serve as gifts
for Lucille. Slender as his means were he could not
leave a service entirely unrequited. He bought a
locket and a pair of earrings, at the old man’s own
price, and left him delighted with his visitor, and
pledged to obtain Mademoiselle Dumarques’ address,
even should the tenant of number seventeen prove
unwilling to give it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br>
<span class="fs70">THE STORY GROWS CLEARER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Britannique was a handsome hotel on the
quay, bright of aspect and many-balconied. The
house had a busy look, and early as it was—not long
after noon—a long table in the gaily-decorated dining-room
was already laid for the table d’hôte. Thereupon
Lucius beheld showy pyramids of those woolly
peaches and flavourless grapes and wooden pears
which seem peculiar to the soil of France—the Deadsea
apples of a table d’hôte dessert. Already napkins,
spread fan-shape, adorned the glasses, ranged in
double line along the vast perspective of tablecloth.
Waiters were hurrying to and fro across the hall,
chamber-maids bawled to each other—as only French
chamber-maids can bawl—on the steep winding staircase.
An insupportable odour of dinner—strongly
flavoured with garlic—pervaded the atmosphere.
Tourists were hurriedly consulting time-tables, as if
on the point of departure; other tourists, just arrived
and burdened with luggage, were gazing disconsolately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
around, as if doubtful of finding accommodation.
Habitués of the hotel were calmly smoking
their midday cigarettes, and waiting for the dainty
little breakfast which the harassed cook was so slow
to produce through yonder hatch in the wall, to which
hungry eyes glanced impatiently.</p>

<p>In a scene so busy it hardly seemed likely that
Lucius would find any one willing to lend an ear, or
to sit calmly down and thoughtfully review the past,
in order to discover the identity of those English
guests who had taken Félicie Dumarques away from
her joyless home. He made the attempt notwithstanding,
and walked into a neat little parlour to the
left, where two disconsolate females—strangers to
each other and regardless of each other’s woes—were
poring over the mysteries of a couple of railway-guides;
and where a calm-looking middle-aged female,
with shining black hair and neat little white-lace cap,
sat at a desk making out accounts.</p>

<p>To this tranquil personage Mr. Davoren addressed
himself.</p>

<p>‘Could I see the proprietor of the hotel?’</p>

<p>The lady shrugged her shoulders dubiously. As
a rule, she told Lucius, the proprietor did not permit
himself to be seen. He had his servants, who
arranged everything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>‘Cannot I afford you any information you may
require, monsieur?’ she asked, with an agreeable
smile.</p>

<p>‘That, madame, will depend upon circumstances.
May I ask how long you have been in your present
position?’</p>

<p>‘From the age of eighteen. Monsieur Dolfe—the
proprietor—is my uncle.’</p>

<p>‘That may be at most ten years,’ said Lucius, with
gallantry.</p>

<p>‘It is more than twenty, monsieur.’</p>

<p>Lucius expressed his amazement.</p>

<p>‘Yes, monsieur, I have kept these books more
than twenty years.’</p>

<p>‘You must be very tired of them, I should think,’
said Lucius, who saw that the lady was good-natured,
and inclined to oblige him.</p>

<p>‘I am accustomed to them, monsieur, and custom
endears even the driest duty. I took a week’s holiday
at Dieppe last summer, for the benefit of my
health, but believe me I missed my books. There
was a void. Pleasure is all very well for people who
are used to it, but for a woman of business—that
fatigues!’</p>

<p>‘The inquiry which I wish to make relates to
some English people who were staying for a short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
time in this house—about four-and-twenty years ago,
and whose names I am anxious to discover.’</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Dolfe elevated her black eyebrows
to an almost hazardous extent.</p>

<p>‘But, monsieur, four-and-twenty years ago! You
imagine that I can recall visitors of four-and-twenty
years ago? English visitors—and this hotel is three-parts
filled with English visitors every year from May
to October. Thirty English visitors will sit down to-day
at our table d’hôte, that is to say, English and
American, all the same.’</p>

<p>‘It might be impossible to remember them unassisted;
yet there are circumstances connected with
these people which might recall them to you. But
you have books in which visitors write their
names?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, if it pleases them. They are even asked
to write; but there is no law to compel them; there
is no law to prevent them writing a false name. It
is a mere formula. And if I can find the names,
supposing you to know the exact date, how are we to
identify them with the people you want? There are
several names signed in the visitors’-book every day
in our busy season. People come and go so quickly.
It is an impossibility which you ask, monsieur.’</p>

<p>‘I think if I had time for a quiet chat with you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
I might bring back the circumstances to your recollection.
It is a very important matter—a matter
which may seriously affect the happiness of a
person very dear to me, or I would not trouble
you.’</p>

<p>‘A person very dear to you! Your betrothed
perhaps, monsieur?’ inquired Mademoiselle Dolfe,
with evident sympathy.</p>

<p>Lucius felt that his cause was half won.</p>

<p>‘Yes, madame,’ he said, ‘my betrothed, whose
mother was a native of your city.’</p>

<p>This clenched the matter. Mademoiselle Dolfe
was soft-hearted and sentimental. Even the books,
and the perpetual adding-up of dinners and breakfasts,
service, appartements, bougies, siphons, bouteilles,
demi-bouteilles, and those fatal sundries which
so fearfully swell an hotel bill—even this hard exercise
of an exact science had not extinguished that
vital spark of heavenly flame which Mademoiselle
Dolfe called her soul. She had been betrothed herself,
once upon a time, to the proprietor of a rival
establishment, who had blighted her affections by
proving inconstant to his affianced, and only too constant
to the brandy-bottle. She had not forgotten
that springtime of the heart, those halcyon summer
evenings when she and her Gustave had walked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
hand-in-hand in the shadowy avenues across yonder
bridge. She sighed, and looked at Lucius with the
glance of compassion.</p>

<p>‘Would it be possible for you to give me half-an-hour’s
quiet conversation at any time?’ asked
Lucius pleadingly.</p>

<p>‘There is the evening,’ said Mademoiselle Dolfe.
‘My uncle is a severe sufferer from gout, and rarely
leaves his room; but I do not think he would object
to receive you in the evening for half an hour. He
has all the old books of the hotel in his room—they
are indeed his only library. When in want of a distraction
he compares the receipts of past years with
our present returns, or examines our former tariffs,
with a view to any modification, the reduction or increase
of our present charges. If you will call this
evening at nine o’clock, monsieur, I will induce my
uncle to receive you. His memory is extraordinary;
and he may be able to recall events of which I, in
my frivolous girlhood, took little notice.’</p>

<p>‘I shall be eternally obliged to him, and to you,
madame,’ said Lucius. ‘In the mean time, if you
will kindly send a porter for my bag, which I left at
the station, I will take up my abode here. I shall
then be on the spot whenever Monsieur Dolfe may be
pleased to receive me.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>‘You will stay here to-night, monsieur?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I will stay to-night. Unhappily I must go
on to Paris to-morrow morning.’</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Dolfe surveyed a table of numbers,
and rang for a chambermaid.</p>

<p>‘Show this gentleman to number eleven,’ she
said; and then, turning to Lucius, she added graciously,
‘It is an airy chamber, giving upon the river,
monsieur, and has but been this instant vacated. I
shall have a dozen applications when the next train
from Dieppe comes in.’</p>

<p>Lucius thanked Mademoiselle Dolfe for this mark
of favour, and went up to number eleven to refresh
himself after his journey, with the assistance of as
much cold water as can be obtained by hook or by
crook in a foreign hotel. His toilet made, he descended
to the coffee-room, where he endeavoured to
derive entertainment from a flabby Rouen journal
while his tardy breakfast was being prepared. This
meal dispatched, he went out into the streets of the
city, looked for the picturesque old bits he remembered
on his last visit, mooned away a pleasant hour
in the cathedral, looked in at St. Ouen, and finished
his afternoon in the Museum of Arts, contemplating
the familiar old pictures, and turning the vellum
leaves of a noble missal in the library.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>He dined at the table d’hôte, and after dinner
returned to the Rue Jeanne d’Arques.</p>

<p>The little watchmaker had a triumphant air, and
at once handed him a slip of flimsy paper with an address
written on it in a niggling fly-leggish caligraphy.</p>

<p>‘I had a good deal of trouble with my neighbour,’
he said. ‘He is a disagreeable person, and
we have embroiled ourselves a little on the subject of
our several dustbins. He objects to vegetable matter;
I object more strongly to the shells of stale fish,
of which he and his lodgers appear to devour an inordinate
quantity, judging from the contents of his
dustbin. When first I put the question about Mademoiselle
Dumarques I found him utterly impracticable.
He knew his landlady’s address, certainly,
but it was not his business to communicate her address
to other people; she might object to have her
address made known; it might be a breach of confidence
on his part. I was not a little startled when,
with a sudden burst of rage, he brought his clenched
fist down upon the table. “Sacrebleu!” he cried;
“I divine your intention. Traitor! You are going
to write to Mademoiselle Dumarques about my dustbin.”
I assured him, as soon as I recovered my scattered
senses, that nothing was farther from my
thoughts than his dustbin. Nay, I suggested that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
we should henceforward regulate our dustbins upon
a system more in accord with the spirit of the <em>contrat
social</em> than had hitherto prevailed between us.
In a word, by some judicious quotations from the
inimitable Jean Jacques, I finally brought him to a
more amiable frame of mind, and induced him to
give me the address, and to tell me all he knows
about Mademoiselle Dumarques.’</p>

<p>‘For which devotion to my cause I owe you a
thousand thanks,’ said Lucius.</p>

<p>‘Nay, monsieur, I would do much more to serve
a fellow creature. The address you have there in
your hand. It appears that Mademoiselle Dumarques
set up in business for herself some years ago at that
address, where she resides alone, or with some pupil
to whom she confides the secrets of her art.’</p>

<p>Lucius repeated his acknowledgments, and took
his leave of the loquacious watchmaker. But he did
not quit the Rue Jeanne d’Arques without pausing
once more to contemplate the quiet old house in
which Lucille’s fair young mother had drooped and
died, divided from her only child, and in a measure
deserted by her husband. A shadowed life, with but
a brief glimpse of happiness at best.</p>

<p>He reëntered the hotel a few minutes before nine.
The little office on the left side of the hall, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
Mademoiselle Dolfe had been visible all day, and always
employed, was abandoned. Mademoiselle had
doubtless retired into private life, and was ministering
to her gouty uncle. Lucius gave his card to a
waiter, requesting that it might be taken to Mademoiselle
Dolfe without delay. The waiter returned
sooner than he could have hoped, and informed him
that Monsieur and Mademoiselle would be happy to
receive him.</p>

<p>He followed the waiter to a narrow staircase at
the back of the house, by which they ascended to
the entresol. Here, in a small sitting-room, with a
ceiling which a moderate-sized man could easily
touch with his hand, Lucius beheld Monsieur Dolfe
reposing in a ponderous velvet-cushioned chair, with
his leg on a rest; a stout man, with very little hair
on his head, but, by way of succedaneum, a gold-embroidered
smoking-cap. The small low room looked
upon a courtyard like a well, and was altogether a
stifling apartment. But it was somewhat luxuriously
furnished, Lucius perceived by the subdued light of
two pair of wax candles—the unfinished bougies of
the establishment were evidently consumed here—and
Monsieur Dolfe and his niece appeared eminently
satisfied with it, and entirely unaware that it
was wanting in airiness and space.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>The books of the hotel, bulky business-like
volumes, were ranged on a shelf in one corner of the
room. Lucius’s eye took that direction immediately;
but Monsieur Dolfe was slow and pompous, and
sipped his coffee as if in no hurry to satisfy the
stranger’s curiosity.</p>

<p>‘I have told my uncle what you wish, Monsieur
Davoren,’ said Mademoiselle graciously, and with a
pleading glance at the old gentleman in the skull-cap.</p>

<p>‘May I ask your motive in wishing to trace
visitors of this hotel—visitors of twenty-four years
back?’ asked Monsieur Dolfe, with an important air.
‘Is it a will case, some disputed testament, and are
you in the law?’</p>

<p>‘I am a surgeon, as my card will show you,’
said Lucius, ‘and the case in which I am interested
has nothing to do with a will. I wish to discover
the secret of a young lady’s parentage—a lady who
at present bears a name which I believe is not her
own.’</p>

<p>‘Humph,’ said Monsieur Dolfe doubtfully; ‘and
there is no reward attaching to your inquiries—you
gain nothing if successful?’</p>

<p>‘I may gain a father, or at least a father’s name,
for the girl I love,’ answered Lucius frankly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>Monsieur Dolfe appeared disappointed, but Mademoiselle
was enthusiastic.</p>

<p>‘Ah, see you,’ she cried to her uncle, ‘is it not
interesting?’</p>

<p>Lucius stated his case plainly. At the name of
Dumarques Monsieur Dolfe pricked up his ears.
Something akin to emotion agitated his bloated face.
A quiver of mental pain convulsed his triple chin.</p>

<p>‘You are familiar with the name of Dumarques?’
said Lucius, wondering.</p>

<p>‘Am I familiar with it? Alas, I know it too well!’</p>

<p>‘You knew Félicie Dumarques?’</p>

<p>‘I knew Félicie Dumarques’ mother before she
married that old skinflint who murdered her.’</p>

<p>‘But, my uncle!’ screamed Mademoiselle.</p>

<p>‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tais-toi</i>, child! I know it was slow murder. It
came not within the law. It was an assassination
that lasted months and years. How often have I
seen that poor child’s pale face! No smile ever brightened
it, after her marriage with that vile miser. She
did not weep; she did not complain. The angels in
heaven are not more spotless than she was as wife
and mother. She only ceased to smile, and she
died by inches. No matter that she lived twenty
years after her marriage—it was gradual death all
the same.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>Monsieur Dolfe was profoundly moved. He pushed
back his skull-cap, exposing his bald head, which he
rubbed despondently with his fat white hand.</p>

<p>‘Did I know her? We were neighbours as children.
My parents and hers lived side by side. Her
father was a notary—above my father in station; but
she and I played together as children—went to the
same school together as little ones—for the notary
was poor, and Lucille—’</p>

<p>‘Lucille!’ repeated Lucius.</p>

<p>‘Yes, Madame Dumarques’ name was Lucille.’</p>

<p>‘I understand. Go on, pray, monsieur.’</p>

<p>‘Monsieur Valneau, Lucille’s father, was poor, I
repeat, and the children—there were several—were
brought up anyhow. Thus we saw more of each
other than we might have done otherwise. Lucille
and my sister were fast friends. She spent many an
evening in our house, which was in many ways more
comfortable than the wretched <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">troisième</i> occupied by
the Valneau family. This continued till I was sixteen,
and Lucille about fourteen. No word of love had
passed between us, as you may imagine, at that early
age; but I had shown my devotion to her as well as
a boy can, and I think she must have known that I
adored her. Whether she ever cared, even in the
smallest degree, for me, is a secret I shall never know.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
At sixteen years of age my father sent me to Paris
to learn my uncle’s trade—my uncle preceded me,
you must know, monsieur, in this house—and I remained
there till I was twenty-three. When I came
back Lucille had been two years married to André
Dumarques. My sister had not had the heart to write
me the news. She suffered it to stun me on my
return. Valneau’s difficulties had increased. Dumarques
had offered to marry Lucille and to help her
family; so the poor child was sacrificed.’</p>

<p>‘A sad story,’ said Lucius.</p>

<p>‘And a common one,’ resumed Monsieur Dolfe.</p>

<p>‘The young lady in whom I am interested—in a
word, my promised wife—is the granddaughter of this
very Lucille Dumarques,’ said Lucius, to the profound
astonishment of Monsieur Dolfe.</p>

<p>He produced the miniature, which served in some
manner for his credentials.</p>

<p>‘I remember both faces,’ said Monsieur Dolfe.
‘Félicie Dumarques, and the Englishman who stayed
in this house for a week, and was seen driving about
the town with Félicie. Unhappily that set people
talking; but the poor child died only a month later,
and carried her secret to the grave.’</p>

<p>‘There was no shameful secret,’ said Lucius.
‘That man was Félicie’s husband.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>‘Are you sure of that?’</p>

<p>‘I have it from the best authority. And now,
monsieur, you will do me a service if you can recall
the name of that Englishman.’</p>

<p>‘But it is difficult,’ exclaimed Monsieur Dolfe.
‘I was never good at remembering names, even of
my own nation, and to remember an English name
after twenty years—it is impossible.’</p>

<p>‘Not twenty years. It cannot be more than
eighteen since that Englishman was in Rouen. But
do not trouble yourself, Monsieur Dolfe. Even if you
remembered, it might be but wasted labour. This
gentleman was especially anxious to keep his marriage
a secret. He would therefore most likely come
here in an assumed name.’</p>

<p>‘If he troubled himself to give us any name at
all,’ said Monsieur Dolfe. ‘Many of our guests are
nameless—we know them only as Number 10 or
Number 20, as the case may be.’</p>

<p>‘But there is a name which I should be very
glad if you could recall, and that is the name of the
lady and gentleman—brother and sister—elderly
people—who took Félicie Dumarques away with them,
as attendant to the lady, when she left Rouen. As
you were interested in the Dumarques’ family, that
is a circumstance which you may possibly remember.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>‘I recall it perfectly,’ cried Monsieur Dolfe, ‘that
is to say, the circumstance, but as for the name, it
is gone out of my poor head. But in this case I
think the books will show. Tell me the year—four-and-twenty
years ago, you say. It was in the
autumn, I remember. They had been here before,
and were excellent customers. The lady an invalid,
small, pale, fragile. The gentleman also small and
pale, but apparently in fair health. He had a valet
with him. But the lady’s-maid had fallen ill on the
road. They had sent her back to her people. But
I remember perfectly. It was my idea to recommend
Félicie Dumarques. Her father, with whom I kept on
civil terms—in my heart of hearts I detested him, but
an hotel-keeper must have no opinions—had told me
his youngest girl was unhappy at home since her
mother’s death, and wanted a situation as useful
companion—or even maid—to a lady. The little
pale old lady looked as if she would be kind—the
little pale old gentleman was evidently rich. There
could not be much work to do, and there would doubtless
be liberal pay. In a word, the situation seemed
made for Félicie. I sent for her—the old lady was
delighted, and engaged her on the spot. She was to
have twenty-five pounds a year, and to be treated like
a lady. There is the whole story, monsieur.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>‘A thousand thanks for it. But the name.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, how you are impatient! We will come to
that presently. Think, Florine,’ to Mademoiselle
Dolfe, who rejoiced in this euphonious name, ‘you
were a girl at the time, but you must have some
recollection of the circumstances.’</p>

<p>Florine Dolfe shook her head with a sentimental
air; indeed, sentiment seemed to run in the Dolfe
family.</p>

<p>‘Alas, I remember but too well,’ she said. ‘It
was in the year when—when I believed that there
was perfect happiness upon the earth;’ namely, before
she had been jilted by the faithless Gustave.
‘It was early in September.’</p>

<p>‘Bring me volume six of the daybook and volume
one of the visitors’-book,’ said Monsieur Dolfe,
pointing to the shelves.</p>

<p>His niece brought two bulky volumes, and laid
them on the table before the proprietor. He turned
the leaves with a solemn air, as if he had just completed
the purchase of the last of the Sibylline volumes.</p>

<p>‘September ’41,’ said Monsieur Dolfe, running
his puny forefinger along the list of names. ‘2d,
Binks, Jones, Dulau, Yokes, Stokes, Delphin.’ Lucius
listened intently for some good English name
with the initial G. ‘3d, Purdon, Green, Vancing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
Thomas, Binoteau, Gaspard, Smith.’ Lucius shook
his head despondently. ‘4th, Lomax, Trevor, Dupuis,
Glenlyne.’</p>

<p>Lucius laid his hand on the puffy forefinger.</p>

<p>‘Halt there,’ he said, ‘that sounds like a good
name.’</p>

<p>‘Good name or bad name,’ exclaimed the proprietor,
‘those are the people—Mr. Reginald Glenlyne,
Miss Glenlyne, and servant, from Switzerland,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> for London. Those are the people. Yes,
I remember perfectly. Now look at the daybook.’</p>

<p>He opened the other Sibylline volume, found the
date, and pointed triumphantly to the page headed
‘Numbers 5, 6, and 7,’ beneath which heading appeared
formidable entries of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">recherché</i> dinners, choice
wines, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bougies</i>, innumerable teas, coffees, soda-waters,
baths, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voitures</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>‘They occupied our principal suite of apartments,’
said Monsieur Dolfe grandly; ‘the apartment we
give to ambassadors and foreign potentates. There
is no doubt about it—these are the people.’</p>

<p>Monsieur Dolfe might have added, that in this
age of economic and universal travelling he did not
often get such good customers. Such thought was
in his mind, but Monsieur Dolfe respected the dignity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
of his proprietorial position, and did not give
the thought utterance.</p>

<p>This was a grand discovery. Lucius considered
that to have found out the name of these people was
a strong point. If the man who signed himself
H. G. was this lady’s nephew, his name was in all
probability Glenlyne also. The initial being the
same, it was hardly too much to conclude that he
was a brother’s son, and bore the family name of his
maiden aunt. Lucius felt that he could now approach
Mademoiselle Dumarques in a strong position.
He knew so much already that she would
scarcely refuse him any farther information that it
was in her power to give.</p>

<p>He had nothing to offer Monsieur and Mademoiselle
Dolfe except the expression of his gratitude,
and that was tendered heartily.</p>

<p>‘If ever I am happy enough to marry the young
lady I have told you about, I will bring my wife here
on our wedding tour,’ he said; a declaration at which
Mademoiselle Dolfe melted almost to tears.</p>

<p>‘I should be very glad to see Lucille Valneau’s
granddaughter,’ said Monsieur Dolfe. He too remembered
the halcyon days of youth, when he had
loved and dreamed his dream of happiness.</p>

<p>Lucius slept more soundly than he had slept for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
many nights on the luxurious spring mattresses of
number eleven, lulled by the faint ripple of the river,
the occasional voices of belated pedestrians softened
by distance, the hollow tramp of footsteps on the
pavement. He rose early, breakfasted, and set out for
the cemetery on the hill, where, after patient search,
he found the Dumarques’ grave. All the family,
save Julie, slumbered there. Lucille Dumarques,
the faithful and beloved wife of André Dumarques—<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Priez
pour elle</i>—and then André Dumarques, and
then Félicie, aged twenty-four; here there was no
surname—only ‘Félicie, daughter of the above-named
André Dumarques;’ and then Hortense, at the riper
age of forty-one. The grave was gaily decked with
a little blue-and-gold railing, enclosing a tiny flower-garden,
where chrysanthemums and mignonette were
blooming in decent order. The sister in Paris doubtless
paid to have this family resting-place kept neatly.</p>

<p>Here Lucius lingered a little while, in meditative
mood, looking down at the noble curve of the widening
river—the green Champagne country on the opposite
shore—and thinking of the life that had ended
in such deep sadness. Then he gathered a sprig of
mignonette for Lucille, put it carefully in his pocket-book,
and departed in time to catch the midday
train for Paris.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br>
<span class="fs70">JULIE DUMARQUES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle Dumarques</span> had thriven in a quiet
steady-going way. She had not risen to be a court
milliner. She did not give fashions to Europe, America,
and the colonies, or employ the genius of rising
draughtsmen to design her costumes. She was of
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i>, and lived by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i>. Her
abode was a second floor in one of the quiet respectable
streets in that half-deserted quarter of Paris
which lies on the unfashionable side of the Seine;
an eminently gloomy street which seemed to lead to
nowhere, but was nevertheless the abode of two or
three important business firms. Here Mademoiselle
Dumarques confectioned gowns and bonnets, caps
and mantles, on reasonable terms, and in strict accordance
with the fashions of last year.</p>

<p>Lucius ascended a dingy staircase, odorous with
that all-pervading smell of stewed vegetables which
is prone to distinguish French staircases—an odour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
which in some manner counterbalances the advantages
of that more savoury <em>cuisine</em>, so often
vaunted by the admirers of French institutions to the
discredit of British cooks. A long way up the dingy
staircase Lucius discovered a dingy door, on which,
by the doubtful light, he was just able to make out
the name of ‘Mademoiselle Dumarques, Robes et
Chapeaux.’ He rang a shrill bell, which summons
produced a shrill young person in a rusty-black silk
gown, who admitted him with a somewhat dubious
air, as if questioning his ability to order a gown or
a bonnet. The saloon into which he was ushered
had a tawdry faded look. A few flyblown pink tissue-paper
models of dresses, life size, denoted the profession
of its occupant. A marble-topped commode
was surmounted by a bonnet, whose virgin beauties
were veiled by yellow gauze. The room was clean
and tidily kept, but was spoiled by that cheap finery
which is so often found in a third-rate French apartment.
A clock which did not go; a pair of lacquered
candelabra, green with age, yet modern enough to be
commonplace; a sofa of the first empire, originally
white and gold, but tarnished and blackened by the
passage of time; chairs, velvet-covered, brass-nailed,
and clumsy; carpet threadbare; curtains of a gaudy
imitation tapestry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>Mademoiselle Dumarques emerged from an inner
chamber with a mouthful of pins, which she disposed
of in the band of her dress as she came. She was
tall, thin, and sallow, might once have been passably
good-looking, but was in every respect unlike the
portrait of Félicie.</p>

<p>‘I come, madame,’ said Lucius, after the politest
possible reception from the lady, who insisted that
he should take the trouble to seat himself in one of
the uncomfortably square arm-chairs, whose angles
were designed in defiance of the first principles of
human anatomy—‘I come to speak to you of a subject
which I cannot doubt is very near to your heart.
I come to speak of the dead.’</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Dumarques looked at him wonderingly,
but said nothing.</p>

<p>‘I come to you on an important matter connected
with your sister, Mademoiselle Félicie, afterwards
Mrs. Glenlyne.’</p>

<p>He made a bold plunge; for, after all, the name
might not have been Glenlyne; and even if it were,
Mademoiselle Dumarques might have known nothing
about it. But the name elicited no expression of
surprise from Mademoiselle Dumarques. She shook
her head pensively, sighed, wiped away a tear from
her sharp black eyes, and then asked,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>‘What can you have to say to me about my sister,
Madame Glenlyne?’</p>

<p>The name was evidently right.</p>

<p>‘I come to you to speak of her only child, Lucille;
who has been brought up in ignorance of her parents,
and whom it is my wish to restore to her rightful
position in society.’</p>

<p>‘Her rightful position!’ cried Julie Dumarques,
with a scornful look in her hard pinched face; ‘her
rightful position in society, as a milliner’s niece!
You are vastly mistaken, sir, if you suppose that it
is in my power to assist my niece. I find it a hard
struggle to support myself by the labour of my
hands.’</p>

<p>‘So,’ thought Lucius, ‘Mademoiselle Julie inherits
her father’s miserly nature. She has a house
in Rouen which must bring her in seventy to a hundred
pounds a year, and she has a fairly prosperous
business, but repudiates the claims of her niece.
Hard world, in which blood is no thicker than water.
Thank Heaven, my Lucille needs nothing from her
kindred.’</p>

<p>‘I am happy to tell you, madame,’ he said after
a little pause, ‘that Miss Glenlyne asks and requires
no assistance from you or any other relative.’</p>

<p>‘I am very glad to hear that,’ answered Mademoiselle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
Julie. ‘Of course I should be pleased to
hear of the poor child’s welfare, though I have never
seen her face, and though her mother treated me in
no very sisterly spirit, keeping from me the secret of
her marriage, while she confided it to my sister
Hortense. True that I was here at the time of her
return to Rouen, and too busy to go yonder to see
her. The tidings of her death took me by surprise.
I had no idea of her danger, or I should naturally
have gone to see her. But as for Félicie’s marriage
or the birth of her child, I knew nothing of either
event till after the death of my sister Hortense, when
I found some letters and a kind of journal, kept
by poor Félicie, among her papers.’</p>

<p>‘Will you let me see that journal and those
letters?’ asked Lucius eagerly.</p>

<p>‘I should hardly be justified in showing them to
a stranger.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps not; but although a stranger to you,
mademoiselle, I have a strong claim upon your kindness
in this matter.’</p>

<p>‘Are you a lawyer?’</p>

<p>‘No. I have no mercenary interest in this matter.
Your niece, Lucille Glenlyne, is my promised wife.’</p>

<p>He produced the double miniature and the
packet of letters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>‘These,’ he said, ‘will show you that I do not
come to you unacquainted with the secrets of your
sister’s life. My desire is to restore Lucille to her
father, if he still lives; or, in the event of his death,
to win for her at least a father’s name.’</p>

<p>‘And a father’s fortune!’ exclaimed Mademoiselle
Julie hastily; ‘my niece ought not to be deprived of
her just rights. This Mr. Glenlyne was likely to inherit
a large fortune. I gathered that from his letters
to my sister.’</p>

<p>‘Yet in all these years you have made no attempt
to seek out your niece, or to assist her in establishing
her rights,’ said Lucius, with some reproach in his
tone.</p>

<p>‘In the first place, I had no clue that would assist
such a search,’ answered Julie Dumarques, ‘and in the
second place, I had no money to spend on lawyers. I
had still another reason—namely, my horror of crossing
the sea. But with you the case is different—as
my niece’s affianced husband, you would profit by any
good fortune that may befall her.’</p>

<p>‘Believe me, that contingency is very far from
my thoughts. I want to do my duty to Lucille; but
a life of poverty has no terror for me if it be but
shared with her.’</p>

<p>‘The young are apt to take that romantic view of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
life,’ said Mademoiselle Dumarques, with a philosophic
air; ‘but their ideas are generally modified in after
years. A decent competence is the only solace of
age;’ and here she sighed, as if that decent competence
were not yet achieved.</p>

<p>‘Will you let me see those letters, mademoiselle?’
asked Lucius, coming straight to the point. ‘I have
shown you my credentials; those letters in your sister’s
hand must prove to you that I have some interest in
this case, even should you be inclined to doubt my
own word.’</p>

<p>Mademoiselle shrugged her shoulders, in polite
disavowal of any such mistrust.</p>

<p>‘I have no objection to your looking over the
letters, in my presence,’ she said; ‘and I hope, if by
my assistance my niece obtains a fortune, she will
not forget her poor aunt Julie.’</p>

<p>‘I doubt not, mademoiselle, that the niece will
show more consideration for the aunt than the aunt
has hitherto shown for the niece.’</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Dumarques sighed plaintively.
‘What was I to do, monsieur, with narrow means,
and an insurmountable terror of crossing the sea?’</p>

<p>‘The transit from Calais to Dover is no doubt
appalling,’ said Lucius.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Dumarques took him into her den;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
or the laboratory in which she concocted those
costumes which were to ravish the Parc Monceau or
the Champs Elysées on a Sunday afternoon. It was
a small and stifling apartment behind the saloon in
which mademoiselle received her customers—a box
of a room ten feet by nine, smelling of coffee, garlic,
and a suspicion of cognac, and crowded with breadths
of stuff and silk, lining, pincushions, yard measures,
paper patterns, and all the appliances of the mantuamaker’s
art. Here the shrill-voiced young apprentice
stitched steadily with a little clicking noise, while
Mademoiselle Dumarques opened a brass-inlaid desk,
and produced therefrom a small packet of papers.</p>

<p>Lucius seated himself at a little table by the
single window, and opened this packet.</p>

<p>There were about a dozen letters, some of them
love-letters, written to a person of humbler station
than the writer. Vague at first, and expressing only
a young man’s passion for a lovely and attractive
girl; then plainly and distinctly proposing marriage
‘since my Félicie is inexorable on this point,’
said the writer, ‘but our marriage must be kept a
secret for years to come. You must tell my aunt
that you are summoned home by your father, and
leave abruptly, not giving her or my uncle time for
any inquiries. You can let a servant accompany<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
you to the station, taking your luggage with you,
and you can leave by the eight-o’clock train for Newhaven
before that servant’s eyes. At Croydon I will
meet you, get your luggage out of the van, and bring
you back to London in time for our marriage to take
place at the church in Piccadilly by half-past eleven
that morning. We are both residents in the parish,
so there will be no difficulty about the license, only
to avoid all questioning I shall have to describe you
as an Englishwoman, and of age. I have heard of a
cottage near Sidmouth, in Devonshire, which I think
will suit us delightfully for our home; an out-of-the-way
quiet nook, from which I can run up to London
when absolutely necessary. My uncle is anxious
that I should take my degree, as you know. So I
may have to spend some months of the next two
years at Oxford; but even that necessity needn’t
part us, as I can get a place somewhere on the river,
at Nuneham, for instance, for you. Reading for
honours will be a good excuse for continued and close
retirement, and will, I think, completely satisfy the
dear old uncle—whom, even apart from all considerations
about the future, I would not for worlds
offend. Would that he could see things with my
eyes, dearest; but you know I did once sound him as
to a marriage with one in all things my superior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
except in worldly position, and he met me with a
severity that appalled me. Good as he is in many
ways, he is full of prejudice, and believes the Glenlynes
are a little more exalted than the Guelphs or
the Ghibelines. So we must fain wait, not impatiently
but resignedly, till inevitable death cuts
the knot of our difficulties. Heaven is my witness
that if evil wishes could injure, no wicked desire of
mine should hasten my uncle’s end by an hour; but
he is past sixty, and has aged a good deal lately,
so it is not in nature that his life can long stand
between us and the avowal of our union.’</p>

<p>This was the last of the lover’s letters; the next
Lucius found in the little packet was from the husband,
written some years later—written when Félicie
had returned to Rouen.</p>

<p>This letter was despondent, nay, almost despairing,
or rather, expressive of that impatience which
men call despair.</p>

<p>The writer, who in all these letters signed himself
in full, Henry Glenlyne, had failed to get his
degree; had been, in his own words, ignominiously
plucked; but that was an event of two years ago, to
which he referred, retrospectively, as a cause of discontent
in his uncle.</p>

<p>‘The fact is, I’ve disappointed him, Félicie, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
very little more would induce him to throw me over
altogether, and leave his estate to the Worcestershire
Glenlyne Spaldings—my natural enemies, who have
courted him assiduously for the last thirty years.
The sons are Cambridge men, models of propriety;
senior wranglers, prizemen, and heaven knows what
else, and of course have done their best to undermine
me. Yet I know the dear old man loves me better than
the whole lot of them—to be at once vulgar and emphatic—and
that unless I did something to outrage
his pet prejudice, he would never dream of altering
his will, charm they never so wisely. But to declare
our marriage at such a time as this would be simple
madness, and is not to be thought of. You must keep
up your spirits, my dearest girl. If I can bring the
little one over to Rouen, I’ll do it; but I have a
shrewd notion that my uncle has spies about him,
and that my movements are rather closely watched,
no doubt in the interests of the Glenlyne Spaldings;
your expectant legatees have generally their paid
creature in the testator’s household; so it would be
difficult for me to bring her myself, and it is just the
last favour I could ask of Sivewright, as he profits by
the charge of her. It would be like asking him to
surrender the goose that lays golden eggs; and remember,
whatever the man may be, he has done us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
good service; for had he not passed himself off as
your husband when my uncle swooped down upon
us that dreadful day at Sidmouth, the whole secret
would have been out, and I beggared for life. I had a
peep at the little pet the other day; she is growing
fast, and growing prettier every day, and seems happy.
Strange to say, she is passionately fond of Ferdinand,
who, I suppose, spoils her, and she looked at me with
the most entire indifference. I felt the sting of this
strangeness. But in the days to come I will win her
love back again, or it shall go hard with me.’</p>

<p>Then came a still later letter.</p>
<br>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘My Darling,—I am inexpressibly grieved to hear
of your weak health. I shall come over again directly
I can get away from my uncle, and will, at any risk,
bring Lucille with me. At this present writing it is
absolutely impossible for me to get away. My uncle
is breaking fast, and I much fear the G. Spaldings
are gaining ground. The senior wrangler is going to
make a great marriage; in fact, the very match which
my uncle tried to force upon me. This is a blow—for
the old man is warmly attached to the young
lady in question, and even thinks, entirely without
reason, that I have treated her badly. However, I
must trust to his long-standing affection for me to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
vanquish the artifices of my rivals. I hardly think
that he could bring himself to disinherit me after so
long allowing me to consider myself his heir. Keep
up your spirits, my dear Félicie; the end cannot be
far off, and rich or poor, believe in the continued
devotion of your faithfully attached husband,</p>

<p class="right">
‘<span class="smcap">Henry Glenlyne</span>.</p>
<p>
‘<cite>The Albany.</cite>’</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>This was the letter of a man of the world, but
hardly the letter of a bad man. The writer of that
letter would scarcely repudiate the claim of an only
daughter, did he still live to acknowledge her.</p>

<p>The journal, written in a russia-leather covered
diary, consisted of only disjointed snatches, all dated
at Rouen, in the last year of the writer’s life, and all
full of a sadness bordering on despair—not the man’s
impatience of vexation and trouble, but the deep and
settled sorrow of a patient unselfish woman. Many
of the lines were merely the ejaculations of a troubled
spirit, brief snatches of prayer, supplications to the
Mother of Christ to protect the motherless child;
utterances of a broken heart, penitential acknowledgments
of an act of deceit, prayers for forgiveness of a
wrong done to a kind mistress.</p>

<p>One entry was evidently written after the receipt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
of the last letter. It was at the end of the journal,
and the hand that inscribed the lines had been weak
and tremulous.</p>

<p>‘He cannot come to me, yet there is no unkindness
in his refusal. He promises to come soon, to
bring the darling whose tender form these arms yearn
to embrace, whose fair young head may never more
recline on this bosom. O, happy days at Sidmouth,
how they come back to me in sweet delusive dreams!
I see the garden above the blue smiling sea. I hold
my little girl in my arms, or lead her by her soft
little hand as she toddles in and out among the old
crooked apple-trees in the orchard. Henry has promised
to come in a little while; but Death comes
faster, Death knows no delays. I did not wish to
alarm my husband. I would not let Hortense write,
for she would have told him the bitter truth. Yet, I
sometimes ask myself sadly, would that truth seem
bitter to him? Might not my death bring him a
welcome release? I know that he has loved me. I
can but remember that we spent four happy years
together in beautiful England; but when I think of
the difficulties that surround him, the ruin which
threatens him, can I doubt that my death will be a
relief to him? It will grieve that kind heart, but it
will put an end to his troubles. God grant that when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
I am gone he may have courage to acknowledge his
child! The fear that he may shrink from that sacred
duty racks my heart. Blessed Mother, intercede for
my orphan child!’</p>

<p>Then came disjointed passages—passages that
were little more than prayer. Here and there, mingled
with pious hopes, with spiritual aspirations,
came the cry of human despair.</p>

<p>‘Death comes faster than my husband. My
Henry, I shall see thee no more. Ah, if thou lovest
me, my beloved, why dost thou not hasten? It is
hard to die without one pitying look from those dear
eyes, one tender word from that loved voice. Hast
thou forgotten thy Félicie, whom thou didst pursue
so ardently five years ago? I wait for thee now,
dear one; but the end is near. The hope of seeing
thee once again fades fast. Wilt thou have quite
forgotten me ere we meet in heaven? A long life
lies before thee; thou wilt form new ties, and give
to another the love that was once Félicie’s. In that
far land where we may meet hereafter thou wilt look
on me with unrecognising eyes. O, to see thee once
more on earth—to feel thy hand clasping mine as
life ebbs away!’</p>

<p>Lucius closed the little book with a sigh. Alas,
how many a woman’s life ends thus, with a broken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
heart! Happy those finer natures whose fragile clay
survives not the shattered lamp of the soul! There
are some fashioned of a duller stuff, in whom the
mere habit of life survives all that gave life its
charm.</p>

<p>This was all that letters or journal could tell the
investigator. But Lucius told himself that the rest
would be easy to discover. He had name, date,
locality. The name, too, was not a common name;
Burke’s <cite>Landed Gentry</cite> or <cite>County Families</cite> would
doubtless help him to identify that Henry Glenlyne
who married Félicie Dumarques at the church
in Piccadilly. These letters had done much;
for they had assured him of Lucille’s legitimacy.
This made all clear before him; he need no longer
fear to pluck the curtain from the mystery of the
past, lest he should reveal a story of dishonour.</p>

<p>He took some brief notes from Mr. Glenlyne’s
letter, and thanked Mademoiselle Dumarques for her
politeness, promising that if the niece should profit
by the use of these documents, the aunt should be
amply requited for any assistance they afforded; and
then he took a courteous leave of the dressmaker
and her apprentice, the monotonous click of whose
needle had not ceased during his visit.</p>

<p>It was four o’clock in the afternoon when Lucius<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
left Mademoiselle Dumarques. He had thought of
getting back to Dieppe in time for that evening’s
boat, so as to arrive in London by the following morning—he
had taken a return ticket by this longer but
cheaper route. He found, however, that the strain
upon his attention during the last forty-eight hours,
the night journey by Newhaven and Dieppe, combined
with many an anxious day and night in the
past, had completely worn him out.</p>

<p>‘I must have another night’s rest before I travel,
or I shall go off my head,’ he said to himself. ‘I
am beginning to feel that confused sense of time and
place which is the forerunner of mental disturbance.
No; it would be of some importance to me to save a
day, but I won’t run the risk of knocking myself up.
I’ll go back to Dieppe by the next train, and sleep
there to-night.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br>
<span class="fs70">COMING TO MEET HIS DOOM.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> passage from Dieppe to Newhaven was of the
roughest. Lucius beheld his fellow voyagers in the
last stage of prostration, and prescribed for more than
one forlorn female on whom the sea malady had fastened
with alarming grip. The steamer was one
scene of suffering, and Lucius, being happily exempt
from the common affliction, did his best to be useful,
so far as the limited means of treatment on board
the vessel enabled him. The wind was high, and
the passengers on board the Newhaven boat, who
had never seen the waves that beat against the rock-bound
coast of Newfoundland, thought that shipwreck
was within the possibilities of the voyage, and
asked the captain with doleful countenances if he
thought they should ever reach Newhaven.</p>

<p>It was late in the evening when the train from
Newhaven deposited Lucius at London-bridge. But
late as it was, he took a cab, left his bag at his own
door, and then went on to Cedar House. His first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
duty, he told himself, was to Homer Sivewright, the
old man who had so fully trusted him, and so reluctantly
parted with him.</p>

<p>As he drove towards the house, he had that natural
feeling of anxiety which is apt to arise after
absence from any scene in which the traveller is
deeply interested—a vague dread, a lurking fear that
although, according to human foresight, all should
have gone well, yet some unforeseen calamity, some
misfortune unprovided against, may have arisen in
the interval.</p>

<p>The night was cloudy and starless, cold too. The
wind, which had been rising all day, now blew a gale,
and all the dust of the day’s traffic was blown into
the traveller’s face as he drove along the broad and
busy highway. That north-east wind shrieked shrilly
over the housetops of the Shadrack district, and one
might prophesy the fall of many a loose slate and
the destruction of many a flowerpot, hurled untimely
from narrow window-sills, ere the hurricane exhausted
its fury. The leaden cowls that surmounted refractory
chimneys spun wildly round before the breeze,
and in some spots, where tall shafts clustered thickly
and cowls were numerous, seemed in their vehement
gyrations to be holding a witch’s Sabbath in honour
of the storm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>That north-easter had a biting breath, and chilled
the blood of the Shadrackites till they were moved
to dismal prophecies of a hard winter. ‘We allus gets
a hard winter when the heckwinockshalls begins
hearly,’ says one gentleman in the coal-and-potato
line to another. And the north-easter howls its
dreary dirge, as if it said, ‘Cry aloud and lament
for the summer that is for ever gone, for southern
breezes and sunny days that return no more.’</p>

<p>Cedar House looked more than usually darksome
after the brighter skies and gayer colours of a French
city. Those dust and smoke laden old trees, lank
poplars, which swayed and rocked in the gale, that
gloomy wall, those blank-looking windows above it,
inspired no cheering thoughts. There was no outward
sign to denote that any one lay dead in the
house; but it seemed no fitting abode for the living.</p>

<p>As the hansom came aground against the curbstone
in front of the tall iron gate, Lucius was surprised
to see a stout female with a bundle ring the
bell. She clutched her bundle with one hand, and
carried a market-basket on the other arm, and that
process of ringing the bell was not performed without
some slight difficulty. Lucius jumped out of the
cab and confronted the stout female.</p>

<p>‘Mrs. Milderson!’ he exclaimed, surprised, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
woman grasped her burdens and struggled against
the wind, which blew her scanty gown round her
stout legs, and tore her shawl from her shoulders,
and mercilessly buffeted her bonnet.</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir, begging your parding, which I just
stepped round to my place to get a change of linen,
and a little bit of tea and an odd and end of groshery
at Mr. Binks’s in Stevedor-street; for there isn’t a
spoonful of decent tea to be got at the grosher’s
round about here, which I tell Mrs. Magsby when
she offers uncommon kind to fetch any errands I
may want. The wind has been that strong that it’s
as much as I could do to keep my feet, particklar at
the corners. It’s blowin’ a reglar gale. Hard lines
for them poor souls at sea, I’m afeard, sir, and no
less than three hundred and seventy-two immigrins
went out of the Shadrack-basin this very day to Brisbian,
which my daughter Mary Ann saw the wessle
start—a most moving sight, she says.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Milderson talked rather with the air of a
person who wishes to ward off a possible reproof by the
interesting nature of her conversation. But Lucius
was not to be diverted by Brisbane emigrants.</p>

<p>‘I don’t think it was in our agreement that you
were to leave your patient, Mrs. Milderson,’ said he;
‘above all, during my absence.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>‘Lor bless you, Dr. Davoren, I haven’t been away
an hour and a half, or from that to two hours at
most. I only just stepped round to my own place,
and took the grosher’s coming back. I’d scarcely
stop to say three words to Mary Ann, which she
thought it unkind and unmotherly, poor child, being
as she has one leg a little shorter than the other,
and was always a mother’s girl, and ‘prenticed to the
dressmaking at fourteen year old. Of course if I’d
a’ knowed you’d be home to-night, I’d have put off
going; but as to the dear old gentleman, I left him
as comfortable as could be. He took his bit of dinner
down-stairs in the parlour, and eat the best part
of as prime a mutton-chop as you could wish to set
eyes on; but he felt a little dull-like in that room,
he said, without his granddaughter, “though I’m
very glad she’s enjoying the fresh country air, poor
child,” he says; so he went up to his bedroom
again before seven o’clock, and had his cup of tea,
and then began amusing of his self, turning over his
papers and suchlike. And says I, “Have I your
leaf to step round to my place for a hour or so, to
get a change of clothes, Mr. Sivewright?” says I;
and he says yes most agreeable; and that’s the longs
and the shorts of it, Dr. Davoren.’</p>

<p>Lucius said nothing. He was displeased, disquieted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
even, by the woman’s desertion of her post,
were it only for a couple of hours.</p>

<p>Mrs. Magsby had opened the gate before this,
and half Mrs. Milderson’s explanation had taken
place in the forecourt. It had been too dark outside
the house for Lucius to see Mrs. Magsby’s face; but
by the dim lamplight in the hall he saw that she
was unusually pale, and that her somewhat vacant
countenance had a scared look.</p>

<p>‘Begging your pardon, sir,’ she began at once
hurriedly, ‘I hope I haven’t done wrong. I haven’t
forgot what you told me and my husband about not
admitting nobody in your absence; but—’</p>

<p>‘If you <em>have</em> admitted anybody, you have done
very wrong,’ said Lucius decisively. ‘What does it
all mean? I find Mrs. Milderson returning from a
two-hours’ absence, and you in a state of alarm.
What is the matter?’</p>

<p>A straight answer was beyond Mrs. Magsby’s
power to give; she always talked in circles, and began
at the outermost edge of the centre she wanted
to reach.</p>

<p>‘I’m sure, Dr. Davoren, I shouldn’t have dreamt
of doing it if it hadn’t been for the order.’</p>

<p>‘Shouldn’t have dreamed of doing what? What
order?’ demanded Lucius impatiently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>‘When first he came to the gate—which he rang
three times, for my good man was taking a stretch
after his tea, and baby was that fractious with the
spasms I couldn’t lie him down—I told him it was
against my orders, and as much as my place was
worth, being put in charge by a gentleman.’</p>

<p>‘Who came to the gate?’ demanded Lucius; but
Mrs. Magsby rambled on, and was not to be diverted
from her circuitous path by any direct question.</p>

<p>‘If the order hadn’t been reglar, I shouldn’t have
give way; but it was perfeckly correck, from Mr.
Agar, the house-agent, which has put me into many
a house hisself, and his handwriting is well beknown
to me. The gentleman wanted to buy the house of
the owners, with a view to turnin’ it into a factory,
or works of some kind, which he explained hisself
quite affable.’</p>

<p>‘<em>That</em> man!’ cried Lucius aghast. ‘You admitted
that man—the very man of all others who
ought to have been kept out of this house—to prevent
whose admittance here I have taken so much trouble?
You and your husband were put into this
house to defend it from that very man.’</p>

<p>‘Lor, sir, you must be dreaming surely,’ exclaimed
Mrs. Magsby. ‘He was quite the gentleman,
and comin’ like that with the intention to buy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
the house, which I have heard Mr. Agar say as how
the owners wanted to get rid of it, and with the
border to view in Mr. Agar’s own handwriting, how
was I to—’</p>

<p>‘This house belongs to Mr. Sivewright, so long
as he occupies it and pays the rent,’ said Lucius indignantly.
‘You had no right to admit any one
without his permission.’</p>

<p>‘Which I should have ast his leaf, sir, if the dear
old gentleman hadn’t been asleep. Mrs. Milderson
had took up his cup of tea not a quarter of a hour
before, and she says to me as she goes out of this
very hall-door, she says, which Mrs. Milderson herself
will bear witness, being too much of a lady to
go from her word, she says, “Don’t go for to disturb
the old gentleman, as I’ve left him sleepin’ as quiet
as an infant.” And as for care of the property, sir,
it wasn’t possible to be more careful, for before I
showed the gentleman over the place, outbuildins,
and suchlike, which he was most anxious to see,
bein’ as it was them he wanted for his factory, I
calls my husband and whispers to him, “Look sharp
after the property, Jim, while I go round the place
with this gentleman;” and with that my husband
kep in the room where the chaney and things is the
whole time I was away.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>‘How long did the man stay?’ asked Lucius
briefly.</p>

<p>‘Well, sir, that’s the puzzling part of it all, and
what’s been worritin’ me ever since. I never see
him go away. But I make no doubt he went out
the back way—down by them barges, as is easy
enough, you know, and him as active a gentleman as
I ever see.’</p>

<p>‘You did not see him leave? Why, then, he is
in the house at this moment,’ cried Lucius. ‘Why
should he leave? His object was to remain here in
hiding.’</p>

<p>‘I’ve been over every nookt and corner in the
house, sir, since he gave me the slip, as you may
say, for want of better words to express it, though
too much a gentleman, I’m sure, to do anything underhanded,
and so has my husband, up-stairs and
down-stairs till our legs ached again. The gentleman
asks me to show him the back premises first—his
object bein’ space for his works, as he says—and
so I took him through the kitchen and round by the
washhouse and brewhouse, and I opens the door
into the back garden and shows him that, and I
opens the outside shutters of the half-glass door
leadin’ into the back parlour, meanin’ to take him
through the house that way, when I looks round,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
after openin’ the shutters for him to foller me, and
he was gone. There wasn’t a vestige of him—whether
he’d gone back to the hall and let hisself out
quietly, havin’ seen all as he wanted to see, and
p’raps found as the place didn’t meet his views, or
whether he’d gone down the garden and got over the
wall to the barges, is more than I can tell; but gone
he was and gone he is, for me and my husband has
exploded every hinch of the ’ouse from garret to
cellar.’</p>

<p>‘Did you look at that little back staircase I told
you of?’</p>

<p>‘Lor, no, sir; as if any one callin’ hisself a gentleman
and dressed beautiful would go in that hole
of a place, among cobwebs and rotten plaster, and
dangerous too I should think on such a night as
this, with the wind roaring like thunder.’</p>

<p>‘Give me a candle,’ said Lucius; ‘no, I’ll go
up-stairs without one.’</p>

<p>He pulled off his boots and ran rapidly and lightly
up the old staircase and along the corridor. He
opened the door of the little dressing-room where
Lucille had slept, with a noiseless hand, and crept
in. The door of communication between this room
and Mr. Sivewright’s bedchamber stood ajar, and
Lucius heard a familiar voice speaking in the next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
room—speaking quietly enough, in tones so calm
that he stopped by the door to listen.</p>

<p>It was a voice which he could not hear without
a shudder—a voice which he had last heard in the
hut in the American pine-forest, that silent wood
where never came the note of song-bird.</p>

<p>‘Father!’ said the voice, with a quiet bitterness
keener than the loudest passion. ‘Father! in what
have you ever been a father to me? Who taught me
to rob you when I was a child? My mother, you
say! I say it was you who taught me that lesson—you
who denied us a fair share of your wealth—who
hid your gains from us—who hoarded and scraped,
and refused us every pleasure!’</p>

<p>‘Falsehood—injustice,’ cried the tremulous tones
of the old man; ‘falsehood and injustice from first
to last. Because I was laborious, you would have it
that I must needs be rich. Because I was careful,
you put me down as a miser. I tried to build up a
fortune for the future—Heaven knows how much
more for your sake than for my own. You plotted
against me, joined with your mother to deceive and
cheat me, squandered in foolish dissipations the
money which my care would have quadrupled: and
for you, mind—all for you. I never acquired the art
of spending money. I could make it, but I couldn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
spend it. The man who does the first rarely can do
the second. You would have inherited everything.
I told you that. Not once but many times. I tried
to awaken your mind to the expectation of the future.
I tried to teach you that by economy and some little
self-denial in the present you could help me to lay
the foundation of a fortune which should not be contemptible.
You, with your consummate artifice,
pretended to agree with me, and went on robbing
me. This was before you were twelve years old.’</p>

<p>‘The bent of my genius declared itself early,’
said the younger man, with a cynical monosyllabic
laugh. The very note Lucius remembered in the
log-hut.</p>

<p>‘You lied to me and you robbed me, but I still
loved you,’ continued Homer Sivewright, suppressed
passion audible in those faltering tones of age. ‘I
still loved you—you were the only child that had
been born to gladden my lonely heart. I was
estranged from your mother, and knew too well that
she had never loved me. What had I in the world
but you? I made excuses for your wrongdoing. It
is his mother’s influence, I said. What child will
refuse to do what a mother bids him? She confuses
his sense of right and wrong. To serve her he betrays
me. I must get him away from his mother.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
On the heels of this came a hideous revelation from
you. You had quarrelled with your mother—you
had taken up a knife to use against her. It was
time that I should part this tigress and her cub. I
lost no time—spared no expense—gave you the best
education that money could buy—I who wore a
threadbare coat and grudged the price of a pair of
boots, even when my bare feet had made acquaintance
with the pavement. Education, and that of the
highest kind, made no change in you. It gave you
some varnish of manner, but it left you a thief and
a liar. I need not pursue the story of your career.’</p>

<p>‘The survey is somewhat tiresome, I admit, sir,’
said the prodigal, carelessly. ‘Suppose we come to
the point without farther recrimination on either side.
You have your catalogue of wrongs, your bill of indictment;
I mine. Let us put one against the other,
and consider the account balanced. I am ready to
give you a full acquittance. You can hardly refuse
the same favour to an only son, whom you once loved,
who has passed through the purifying furnace of
penury, who comes to you remorseful and yearning
for forgiveness—nay, even for some token of affection.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t waste your breath, Ferdinand Sivewright.
I know you!’ said the old man, with brief bitterness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>‘Nay, I cannot conceive it possible that you
should repulse me,’ replied the son in a tone of infinite
persuasion. That power of music and expression
which was the man’s chief gift lent a strange
magic to his tones; only a deep conviction of his
falsehood could arm a father’s heart against him. ‘I
have made my way to you with extremest difficulty—indeed
only by subterfuge—so closely was your door
shut against me—against me, your only son, returned,
as if from the grave itself, to plead for pardon.’</p>

<p>‘And to rob me,’ said Homer Sivewright, with a
harsh laugh.</p>

<p>‘What opportunity have I had for that? I only
arrived at Liverpool from America three days ago.
Why should I rob you of what, in the natural course
of events, must be my own by and by? Grant that I
wronged you in the past, all that I took was at least
in some part my own, my own, by your direct admission,
in the future, if not mine in the present; and
could a boy perceive the nice distinction between
actual and prospective possession?’</p>

<p>‘You were not a boy when you drugged me in
order to steal the key of my iron safe,’ said the father
in a tone that betrayed no wavering of intention. ‘I
might have forgiven the robbery. I swore at the time
that I would never forgive the opiate. And I mean to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
keep my oath. I said then, and I believe now, that
a man who would do that would, with as little compunction,
poison me.’</p>

<p>Ferdinand Sivewright was standing only a few
paces from the half-open door, so near that Lucius
heard his quickened breathing at this point, heard
even the fierce beating of that wicked heart.</p>

<p>‘From that hour I formed my life on a new plan,’
continued the old man, with a subdued energy that
approached the terrible, a concentration of purpose
that seemed fierce as the glow of metal at a white
heat. ‘From that hour I lived but in the expectation
of such a meeting as this. You left me poor. I
swore to become rich, only for the sake of such a
meeting as this. I toiled and schemed; lent money
at usury, and was pitiless to the victims who borrowed;
denied myself the common necessities of life, ay,
shortened my days; all for such an hour as this. You
would come back to me, I told myself, if I grew rich,
as you have come; you would crawl, as you have
crawled; you would sue for pardon, with hate and
scorn in your heart, as you have sued; and I should
answer you as I do to-night. Not a sixpence that I
have scraped together shall ever be yours; not a penny
that I have toiled for shall buy a crust to ward off your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
hour of starvation. I have found another son. I have
made a will, safe and sure; not a will that your ingenuity
can upset when I am mouldering in my
grave—a will leaving all I possess away from you,
and imposing on those that come after me the condition
that no sixpence of mine shall ever reach you.
After death, as in life, I will punish you for the iniquity
that turned a father’s love to hate.’</p>

<p>‘Madman,’ cried Ferdinand Sivewright, ‘do you
think your will shall ever see the light of day, or you
survive this night? I did not win my way to this
room to be laughed at or defied. You have disinherited
me, have you? I’m glad you told me that.
You have adopted another man for your son, and
made a will in his favour. I’m very glad you told
me that. I wish him joy of his inheritance. You
have chosen your fate. It might have been life:
I came here to give you a fair chance. You choose
death.’</p>

<p>There was a hurried movement, the swift flash
of a narrow pointed knife, that kind of knife by
which Sheffield makes murder easy. But ere that
deadly point could reach its mark a door was flung
open, there came a hurried tread of feet, and two men
were grappling with each other by the bedside, with
that shining blade held high above the head of both.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
Rapid as Ferdinand’s movement had been towards the
bed, Lucius had been quick enough to intercept him.
By the bedside of the intended victim the two men
struggled, one armed with that keen knife, the other
defenceless. The struggle was for mastery of the
weapon. Lucius seized the murderer’s right wrist
with his left hand, and held it aloft. Not long could
he have retained that fierce grip, but here his professional
skill assisted him. His right hand was
happily free. While they were struggling, he took a
lancet from his waistcoat-pocket, and with one rapid
movement cut a vein in that uplifted wrist.</p>

<p>The knife dropped like a stone from Ferdinand
Sivewright’s relaxing grasp, and a shower of blood
came down upon the surgeon and his adversary.</p>

<p>‘I think I have the best of you now,’ said Lucius.</p>

<p>The old man had been pulling a bell-rope with all
his might during this brief struggle, and the shrill
clang of the bell sounded through the empty house,
sounded even above the shrill shriek of the wind in
the chimney.</p>

<p>Ferdinand Sivewright looked about him, dazed
for an instant by that sudden loss of blood, and with
the wild fierce gaze of a trapped animal. So had
Lucius seen a wolverine stare at his captors from the
imprisonment of a timber trap. He looked round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
him, listened to the bell, caught the sound of footsteps
in the corridor, then with a sudden rush across
the room, threw himself with all the force of his full
weight against the oaken panel. The feeble old wood
cracked and splintered as that muscular form was
flung against it, and that side of the room rocked as
the panel fell inwards. Another moment and Ferdinand
Sivewright had disappeared—he was on the
secret staircase—he had escaped them.</p>

<p>Lucius made for the door. He might still be in
time to catch this baffled assassin at the bottom of
the staircase; but on the threshold he stopped,
arrested by a sound of unspeakable horror. That
end of the room by the broken panel still seemed to
tremble; the wooden wall swayed inwards. Then
came a sound like the roar of cannon; it was the
fall of a huge beam that had sustained the wide old
chimney shaft. That mighty crash was succeeded
by a rushing noise from a shower of loose bricks and
plaster; then one deep long groan from below, and
all was silent. The room was full of dust, which almost
blinded its occupants. There was a yawning
gap in the splintered wainscot, where the sliding
panel had been. Pharaoh had tumbled from his
corner, and sprawled ignominiously on the floor. The
huge square chimney, that ponderous relic of mediæval<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
masonry, which had been the oldest portion
of Cedar House, was down; and Ferdinand Sivewright
lay at the bottom of the house, buried under
the ruins of the secret staircase and the chimney of
which it had been a part.</p>

<span class="fs70">‘’TIS WITH US PERPETUAL NIGHT.’</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">They</span> dug Ferdinand Sivewright out from under that
pile of shattered brickwork and fallen timber, after
labours that lasted late into the night. Help had
not been far to seek amongst the good-natured Shadrackites.
Stout navigators and stalwart stevedores
had arisen as if by magic, spade and pickaxe had
been brought, and the work of rescue had begun, as
it seemed, almost before the echo of that thunderous
sound of falling beam and brickwork had died out
of the air.</p>

<p>When Lucius rushed down-stairs he found the
forecourt full of wind-driven lime-dust and crumbled
plaster and worm-eaten wood that drifted into
his face like powder, and a clamorous crowd at the iron
gate eager to know if any one was under the ruins.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ he said, ‘there’s a man yonder. Who’ll
help me to dig him out?’</p>

<p>A chorus of eager voices rent the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>‘Come, half a dozen of the strongest of you,’ said
Lucius, unlocking the gate, ‘and bring picks and
spades.’</p>

<p>The men filed in from among the miscellaneous
crowd, women and babies in the foreground. Stray
boys, frantic to do something, were sent right and
left to fetch spades and picks. The miscellaneous
crowd was forced back from the gate, unwilling to
the last; the gate opened and the men entered, at
once calm and eager, men who had seen peril and
faced death in their time.</p>

<p>‘I knowed that end of the house would come
down some day,’ said one brawny navvy, looking up
at the dilapidated wing. ‘I told the old gent as
much when he employed me to fasten some loose
slates on one of the outhouses, but he didn’t thank
me for my warning. “It’ll last my time,” says he.
Is it the old gent that’s under the rubbidge, sir?’</p>

<p>‘Thank God, no. But there is a man there.
Lose no time. There’s little hope of getting him
out alive, but you can try your best.’</p>

<p>‘That we will,’ cried several voices unanimously.</p>

<p>The stray boys reappeared breathless, and handed
in spades and picks through the half-open gate, which
Lucius guarded. He didn’t want a useless crowd
in the forecourt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<p>‘Now, lads, heave ahead!’ cried a stentorian
voice, and the work began; a tedious labour, for the
wreck of the old chimney made a mighty pile of ruin.</p>

<p>The labour thus fairly started, Lucius went back
to the old man’s room. He found Homer Sivewright
sitting half-dressed upon his bed, staring at that
gap in the opposite wall, shaken terribly, but calmer
than he had hoped to find him.</p>

<p>‘Save him, Lucius,’ cried the old man, clasping
Lucius’s hand. ‘He has been an ingrate—a villain.
There was bad blood in him, a taint that poisoned
his nature—hereditary falsehood. But save him from
such a hideous fate. Is there any hope?’</p>

<p>Lucius shook his head.</p>

<p>‘None, I fear. The fall alone was enough to kill
any man, and that crossbeam may have fallen upon
him. There are half a dozen men clearing away the
rubbish, but all we can hope to find is the dead body
of your son. Better that he should perish thus than
by the gallows.’</p>

<p>‘Which must have been his inevitable doom,
had he been permitted to finish his course,’ said the
old man bitterly.</p>

<p>Lucius helped to remove his patient to Lucille’s
vacant chamber, and tried to calm his agitation—a
vain effort; for though quiet enough outwardly, Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
Sivewright suffered intensely during this interval of
uncertainty.</p>

<p>‘Go down and see how they are getting on,’ he
said eagerly. ‘They must have cleared all away by
this time surely.’</p>

<p>‘I’m going to look for a lantern or two,’ replied
Lucius; ‘the night is as black as Erebus, and that
strong wind makes the work slower.’</p>

<p>Mr. Sivewright told him where to find a couple
of lanterns.</p>

<p>‘Go,’ he cried; ‘don’t waste time here with me.
Rescue my son, if you can.’</p>

<p>His son still—by the mere force of habit, perhaps,
although ten minutes ago his baffled murderer.</p>

<p>Lucius went out to the end of the house with a
couple of lighted lanterns, and remained there moving
about among the men as the work slowly progressed—remained
giving them such help as he
could—sustaining them with counsel—supplying
them with beer, which one of the stray boys, retained
for the purpose, fetched from a neighbouring publichouse
by special license of the policeman, who acknowledged
the necessity of the case—remained
faithful to his post, until, in the dullest coldest hour
of the dark windy night, Ferdinand Sivewright was
discovered under a heap of rafters, which had fallen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
crosswise and made a kind of penthouse above
him.</p>

<p>This accident had just saved him from being
smothered by the fallen rubbish. The massive crossbeam
of the chimney had fallen under him, and not
above him—the long-loosened supports perhaps finally
destroyed by that fierce shock which his own mad
rush at the sliding panel had given to the fabric,
weakened long ago by the injudicious cutting of the
timbers when the old banquet-hall was pulled down.</p>

<p>They lifted him out of the wreck, and, to the
marvel of all of them, alive, although unconscious.
Lucius examined him carefully as he lay upon a heap
of the men’s coats and jackets, pallid, and bloodstained.
Two of the men held the lanterns as Lucius
knelt down beside that awful figure to make
his investigation. Both legs were broken, the ribs
crushed inwards; in short, the case was fatal, though
the man still lived.</p>

<p>‘Come indoors with me,’ cried Lucius, ‘two of
you good fellows, and we’ll pull down a door and put
a mattress upon it; we must take him to the London
Hospital.’</p>

<p>Two men followed him to the house; they
selected one of the doors in the back premises, an
old washhouse door that hung loosely enough on its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
rusty hinges, and proceeded to unscrew this, while
Lucius went up-stairs for a mattress. A few minutes
afterwards they had laid Ferdinand Sivewright on
this extemporary litter, and were carrying him, loosely
covered with a couple of coats, to the London Hospital.</p>

<p>There was a surgical examination by two of the
best men in London early next morning; but as
nothing that surgery could do could have prolonged
that wicked life, the consultation ended only in the
simple sentence, ‘A fatal case.’</p>

<p>‘Do what you can to make the poor fellow comfortable,’
said the chief surgeon; ‘it would be useless
to put him to any pain by trying to set the
broken bones; amputation might have answered, but
for those injuries to the ribs and chest—those alone
would be fatal. I give him about twenty-four hours.
The brain is uninjured, and there may be a return
of consciousness before the end.’</p>

<p>For this Lucius waited, never leaving his post by
the narrow hospital bed. It was important that he
should be at hand, to hear whatever this man might
have to say—most important that he should receive
from these lips the secret of Lucille’s parentage. All
that care or skill could do to alleviate Ferdinand
Sivewright’s sufferings Lucius did, patiently, kindly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
and waited for the end, strong in his trust in Providence.</p>

<p>‘Better that he should perish thus by the visitation
of God than by my hand,’ he said to himself,
with deepest thankfulness.</p>

<p>He telegraphed to his sister, asking her to come
to London immediately, and to bring Lucille with
her. They were to travel by a particular train, and
to go straight to his house, where he would meet
them.</p>

<p>Painful as the scene would be to both, he deemed
it best that both should hear this man’s last words;
that Lucille should be told by his own lips that he
was not her father; that Janet should hear the truth
about her unhappy marriage, from him who alone had
power to enlighten her. It was to give to both a
bitter memory; but it was to relieve the minds of
both from doubt and misconception.</p>

<p>A little before the hour at which Lucius expected
the arrival of Janet and Lucille, the dying
man awoke to consciousness. Lucius at once resolved
not to leave him. He wrote a few lines to
Janet, begging her to come on with Lucille to the
hospital, and dispatched the note by a messenger.</p>

<p>Ferdinand Sivewright looked about him for a
little while with a dull half-conscious wonder. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
with that bitter smile which Lucius remembered
years ago in the log-hut, he said slowly.</p>

<p>‘Another hospital! I thought I’d had enough
of them. I’ve been laid by the heels often enough.
Once in Mexico; another time in British Columbia,
when those Canadian trappers picked me up, half
dead with frost-bites and with a bullet through my
shoulder, a mile or so from that villanous log-hut,
and carried me on to the nearest settlement. Yes,
I thought I’d had enough of sick beds and strange
faces.’</p>

<p>Presently his eyes turned slowly towards Lucius.
He looked at him for a little while with a lazy stare;
then with a sudden fierceness in the dark fever-bright
eyes.</p>

<p>‘<em>You!</em>’ he cried; ‘you, that sent that bullet
into my shoulder! It must be a bad dream that
brings you to my bedside.’</p>

<p>‘I am here to help and not to hurt you,’ answered
Lucius quietly. ‘The end of your life is so
near that there is no time for enmity. I saved you
last night from becoming a parricide; and afterwards
helped to rescue you from a horrible death under the
ruins of the house you had invaded. If it is possible
for such a nature as yours to feel remorse for the
past or apprehension for the future, give the few remaining
hours of your life to penitence and prayer.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>‘What, am I doomed?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, your hours are numbered. Medical skill
can do nothing, except to make your end a little
easier.’</p>

<p>‘That’s bitter,’ muttered Ferdinand. ‘Just as
I saw my grip upon the old man’s hoard. I had
schemes enough in this busy brain to occupy twenty
years more. Dying! How did I come here? What
happened to me? I remember nothing, except that
I got into my father’s house last night to have a little
peaceable conversation with him. Did I see him?
I can’t remember.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t rack your brain to remember. There is
no time to think of your life in detail. Repent, even
at this last hour, and pray to an all-merciful God to
pardon a life that has been all sin.’</p>

<p>‘Let Him answer for the work of His hands,’
cried the sinner. ‘He gave me the passions that
ruled my life—the brain that plotted, the heart that
knew not compunction. If He has His chosen vessels
for good and evil, I suppose I have fulfilled the
purpose of my creation.’</p>

<p>‘May God forgive your blasphemous thought!
To all His creatures He gives the right of choice between
two roads. You, of your own election, chose
the evil path. It is not too late even now to cry to
Him, “Lord, have mercy upon me a sinner!”’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>The dying man closed his eyes, and made no
answer.</p>

<p>‘I don’t suppose I should have been a bad fellow,’
he said by and by, ‘if destiny had provided me
with a handsome income, say ten thousand a year.
The tiger is a decent beast enough till he is hungry.
I’ve had a strange life—a chequered fabric—some
sunshine; a good deal of shadow. You never heard
of me in the United States, I suppose, where I was
best known as Señor Ferdinando, the violin improvisatore?
I was the rage yonder in my time, I can tell
you, and saw the dollars roll in like the golden waters
of Pactolus, and had pretty women going mad about
me by scores. Ferdinando—yes, I was a great man
as Señor Ferdinando.’</p>

<p>He paused with a sigh, half regret, half satisfaction.</p>

<p>‘I had a run of luck at the tables at San Francisco,
when I got the better of that accursed bulletwound—your
bullet, remember—and I didn’t do badly
at the diggings, though I gained more by a lucky
partnership with some hard-working fools than by
actual work. Then came a turn in the tide, and I
landed in this used-up old country without a five-pound
note, and nothing to hope for but the chance
of getting on the blind side of my old father. But
that was difficult.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>‘You contrived to rob him, however,’ said Lucius.</p>

<p>The dying eyes looked at him with the old keen
gaze, as if taking the measure of his knowledge.
But Ferdinand Sivewright did not trouble himself
either to deny or admit the justice of this accusation.</p>

<p>‘In England things went badly with me always;
though I have played the gentleman here in my
time,’ he muttered, and closed his eyes wearily.</p>

<p>Lucius moistened the dry lips with brandy from
a bottle that stood by the bedside.</p>

<p>The messenger returned to say that two ladies
were below in the waiting-room.</p>

<p>Lucius went down-stairs, leaving a nurse in charge
of Ferdinand. He found Janet and Lucille alike
pale and anxious. Lucille was the first to speak.</p>

<p>‘Has anything happened to my grandfather?’
she exclaimed. ‘Is he here? O, Lucius, tell me
quickly.’</p>

<p>‘No, my darling. Mr. Sivewright is safe, at Cedar
House. I have sent for you to see one who has not
very long to remain in this world—the man whom
you once loved as a father.’</p>

<p>‘My father here?’</p>

<p>‘No, Lucille, not your father. Ferdinand Sivewright<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
stole that name, and won your love by a
falsehood.’</p>

<p>‘He was kind to me when I was a child,’ said Lucille.
‘But why is he here? What has happened?’</p>

<p>Lucius told her briefly that there had been an
accident by which Ferdinand Sivewright had been
fatally injured. Of the exact nature of that accident,
and the events that immediately preceded it, he told
her nothing.</p>

<p>To Janet he spoke more fully, when he had taken
her to the other end of the room, out of Lucille’s
hearing.</p>

<p>‘Your husband is found, Janet,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘What?’ she cried; ‘he is living then; and your
friend Mr. Hossack assured me of his death.’</p>

<p>Her first thought was one of regret that Geoffrey
should have pledged himself to a falsehood.</p>

<p>‘Geoffrey was deceived by a train of circumstances
that also deceived me.’</p>

<p>‘He is living, and in this place!’ said Janet, with
a sigh for the man she had once loved.</p>

<p>‘He is dying, Janet. If you want him to acknowledge
any wrong done to you, it is a fitting time to
obtain such a confession.’</p>

<p>‘I will not torture him with questions. I am too
sorry for his mistaken life. Take me to him, Lucius.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>‘And Lucille, she must come with you.’</p>

<p>‘What need has Lucille to be there?’</p>

<p>‘Greater need than you could suppose. Lucille’s
pretended father and your husband are one and the
same person. Come, both of you. There is no time
to lose.’</p>

<p>He led the way to the accident ward, and to the
quiet corner where Ferdinand’s bed stood, shaded,
and in a manner divided, from the rest of the room
by a canvas screen. His was the worst case in that
abode of pain.</p>

<p>Lucille drew near the bed, and at a sign from
Lucius seated herself quietly in the chair by the
dying man’s pillow. Lucius stopped Janet with a
warning gesture, as she was advancing towards the
screen.</p>

<p>‘Not yet,’ he whispered; ‘hear all, but don’t let
him see you.’</p>

<p>Janet obeyed, and remained hidden by the screen.
Ferdinand Sivewright’s eyes wandered to the gentle
face bent tearfully over his pillow.</p>

<p>‘Lucille,’ he gasped, ‘I thought you had abandoned
me.’</p>

<p>‘Not in the hour of your remorse, father,’ she
said; ‘my heart tells me you are sorry for your
sins; for that last worst sin of all I know you must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
be sorry. It is not in nature that you should be
remorseless.’</p>

<p>‘There are anomalies in nature,’ answered Sivewright.
‘I believe I was born without a conscience,
or wore it out before I was ten years old. After all
I have only sinned against my fellow man when I
was desperate; it has been my ultimate expedient.
I have not injured anybody upon fanciful grounds,
for revenge or jealousy, or any of those incendiary
passions which have urged some men to destroy their
kind. I have obeyed the stern law of necessity.’</p>

<p>‘Father, repent; life is ebbing. Have you no
words but those of mockery?’</p>

<p>She took his death-cold hands, trying to fold
them in prayer. He looked at her, and the cynic’s
smile faded. There was even some touch of tenderness
in his look.</p>

<p>‘Do you think the God against whom I have
shut my mind is very likely to take pity upon me
now, at my last gasp, when further sin is impossible?’</p>

<p>‘There is no state too desperate for the hope of
His mercy. Christ died for sinners. The penitent
thief had briefest time for repentance, none for atonement.’</p>

<p>‘I wonder whether he had been doing evil all his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
life; had never done a good action, never truly served
a friend,’ murmured Sivewright in a musing tone.</p>

<p>‘We only know that he had sinned, and was forgiven.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, that’s a slight ground for belief in illimitable
mercy. Can you forgive me, Lucille—you whom
I wronged and deluded, whom I cheated of a birthright?’</p>

<p>‘I do not know what wrong you have done me;
but whatever that wrong may be, Heaven knows how
freely I forgive it. I loved you dearly once.’</p>

<p>‘Ay, once. Poor parasite, why should you love
me, except that it was in your nature to twine your
tendrils about something? And I loved you, little
one, as much as it was in <em>my</em> nature to love anything.
Whatever love I had, I divided between you
and the fiddle I used to play to you in that dusky
old parlour, when we two sat alone by the fire.’</p>

<p>‘Father, by the memory of that time, when I
knew not what sin was—when I thought you good
and true, as you were kind—tell me that you repent
your sins, that you are sorry for having tried to
injure that poor old man.’</p>

<p>‘Repent my sins—sorry,’ he muttered. ‘Well,
I’ll say this much, that if I could begin life afresh,
with a clean conscience and a fair start, I’d try to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
an honest man. Outlaws have their pleasures; but
I think respectability has the best of it in the longrun.’</p>

<p>‘The strongest proof of repentance is the endeavour
to atone,’ said Lucius, who dreaded lest the end
should come ere he had learned all he wanted to
know about Henry Glenlyne. ‘The wrong you did
Lucille Glenlyne was a bitter one, for you robbed
her of a father.’</p>

<p>‘Lucille Glenlyne!’ cried Ferdinand. ‘How came
you by the name of Glenlyne?’</p>

<p>‘Never mind how I learned the name. Your time
is short. Remember that, and if you can be the
means of restoring Lucille to her father, lose not a
moment ere you do that one good act.’</p>

<p>‘An affectionate father,’ said Ferdinand, with the
old mocking tone. ‘He was very glad to be comfortably
rid of his pretty little daughter. He came to
Bond-street a week after his wife’s death, with the
merest apology for a hatband, lest people should ask
him why he was in mourning, and took the little one
on his knee and kissed her, and smoothed her dark
curls, but never told her to call him father; and then,
finding that she was so fond of me, proposed that I
should adopt her altogether, and bring her up as my
own.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span></p>

<p>‘For a consideration, I suppose?’ said Lucius.</p>

<p>‘Yes, he paid me something of course—a sum of
money down—very little—but he was always whining
about his difficulties, and pretended that he could do
no more. After that I lost sight of him altogether.
I had left England before he came into his uncle’s
fortune, and when I wrote to him from South
America, asking him to remember old promises, he
did not answer my letters. When I came back to
England, with some idea of hunting him up and
making him pay me for my discretion, I heard that
he was dead. He was a mean cur at the best of
times, and was never worthy of his wife.’</p>

<p>‘Tell me at least where I can get most information
about him?’ asked Lucius earnestly.</p>

<p>‘From the family lawyers—Pullman and Everill,
Lincoln’s-inn.’</p>

<p>This was something. Lucius had set his heart
upon restoring Lucille’s rightful name before she
changed it for his own. A somewhat useless labour,
it might seem in the abstract; but to an Englishman
that question of name is a strong point.</p>

<p>‘Is that all you can tell me—the only help you
can give me towards reinstating Lucille in any rights
she may have been deprived of through her father’s
desertion of her?’ asked Lucius.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>‘Ay, that’s a question that might be worth looking
into. You’d better look at old Glenlyne’s will.
Henry married a second time, I know, but I don’t
know whether he had children by that second marriage.
I don’t see how I can help you. Henry
Glenlyne married Félicie Dumarques at the church
in Piccadilly—St. James’s—just twenty years ago.
I never had the certificate of the marriage. Hal
Glenlyne kept that himself. But you’ll find the
register. Lucille’s rights—if she has any under
Reginald Glenlyne’s will—may be made out clearly
enough; provided you can identify the child I brought
home to Bond-street as the daughter of Henry
and Félicie Glenlyne. There’s your greatest difficulty.’</p>

<p>The man’s keen intellect, even clouded by pain,
dulled by the dark shadow of death, grasped every
detail, and saw the weak point in the case.</p>

<p>‘I am no fortune-hunter,’ said Lucius, ‘and were
Lucille mistress of a million she could be no dearer
to me than she is now; nor her future life happier
than, with God’s help, I hope to make it. I desire
nothing but that she should have justice—justice to
her dead mother—justice to herself.’</p>

<p>‘You cannot get it out of Henry Glenlyne,’
answered Ferdinand Sivewright. ‘He has slipped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
comfortably into his grave and escaped all reckoning.
He was always a sneak.’</p>

<p>‘Enough. We must look for justice to God, if
man withhold it. There is some one here who
wishes to see you—some one you have wronged as
deeply as you wronged Lucille. Can you bear to see
your wife—my sister Janet?’</p>

<p>‘What, is she here too? You come like the
ghosts that circled crook-back Richard’s bed at Bosworth.’</p>

<p>‘Will you see your wife?’ asked Lucius quietly.</p>

<p>‘Yes. She’ll not reproach me now. Let her
come.’</p>

<p>‘Janet.’</p>

<p>Janet came softly to the bed, and knelt beside
the man whose influence had once been all-powerful
to lead her.</p>

<p>‘Can <em>you</em> forgive me?’ he asked, looking at her
with those awful eyes, whose intensity was slowly
lessening as the dull shade of death dimmed them.
‘Can <em>you</em> forgive? I wronged you worst of all, for I
told you a lie on purpose to break your heart. You
are my lawful wife—I had no other—never loved
any other woman. I stole you secretly from your
home because I knew my character couldn’t stand
investigation, and if I had wooed you openly there’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
have been all manner of inquiries. I knew the keen
prying ways of your petty provincial gentry. It was
easier to make the business a secret, and thus escape
all danger.’</p>

<p>‘You gave me a bitter burden to bear in all these
years,’ Janet answered gently; ‘but I am grateful
even for this tardy justice. May God forgive you as
I do!’</p>

<p>She covered her face with her hands, and her
head sank on the coverlet of the bed, as she knelt in
silent prayer. There could be little to be said between
these two. Janet’s wrongs were too deep for
many words.</p>

<p>Ferdinand stretched out his hand with a feeble
wandering movement, and the tremulous fingers
rested on his wife’s bent head—rested there with a
light and tender touch, it might be in blessing.</p>

<p>‘Father, will you not say one prayer?’ asked Lucille
piteously.</p>

<p>‘I will say anything to please you,’ he answered.</p>

<p>‘No, no, not for me, but for your own sake!
God is all goodness; even to those who turn to Him
at the eleventh hour. His mercies are infinite.’</p>

<p>‘They had need be if I am to have any part in
them.’</p>

<p>Lucille repeated the Lord’s Prayer slowly, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
dying man repeating it after her, in Latin—the words
he had learned in his boyhood when he went to mass
with his mother at the chapel in Spanish-place.</p>

<p>They stayed with him all that day, Lucille reading,
at intervals, words of hope and comfort from
the Gospel—words which may have pierced even
those dull ears with some faint promise, may have
kindled some vague yearning for divine forgiveness
even in that hardened heart. The sinner seemed at
intervals to listen; there was a grateful look now
and then in the tired eyes.</p>

<p>They did not fatigue him, even with these pious
ministrations. The soothing words were read to him
after pauses of silence, and only when he seemed free
from pain. Lucille’s gentle hand bathed the burning
forehead. Janet held the reviving cordial to the pale
parched lips. Had he lived nobly, and perished in
the discharge of some sacred duty, his dying hours
could not have been more gently tended. And thus
the slow sad day wore on, and at dusk he started up
out of a brief slumber, with a sharp cry of pain, and
repeated, in a strange husky voice, the words Lucille
had read to him a little while before:</p>

<p>‘Lord—be merciful—to me—a—’</p>

<p>He lacked strength to finish that brief sentence;
but, conscious to the last, looked round upon them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
all, and then, stretching out his arms to Lucille, fell
upon her neck, and died there.</p>

<p>He had loved the little girl who sat on his knee
in the gloaming, while he played by his father’s fireside,
better than the wife he wronged.</p>

<span class="fs70">LUCIUS IN QUEST OF JUSTICE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Lucius</span> went to Messrs. Pullman and Everill’s office
the day after Ferdinand Sivewright’s death. Mr.
Pullman, an active-looking elderly man, received him
with that stock-in-trade kind of politeness which
thriving solicitors keep for unknown clients, heard
his story, smiled somewhat incredulously at some of
its details, but reserved his opinion until he should
have mastered the case.</p>

<p>‘Isn’t it rather strange that we should never have
heard of this youthful marriage of Mr. Henry Glenlyne’s,’
he said, with his sceptical smile, when the
story was finished, ‘if there had been such a marriage?’</p>

<p>‘Not more strange than that other clandestine
marriages should be kept secret,’ said Lucius.</p>

<p>‘Ah, but they so seldom are kept secret for more
than a year or two; they always transpire somehow.
Facts are like water, Mr. Davoren, and have an odd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
way of leaking out. This supposed marriage, according
to your showing, is an event of twenty years
ago.’</p>

<p>‘There is really no room for speculation upon
the subject,’ said Lucius coolly. ‘You can easily
verify my statement by a reference to the registries of
St. James’s, Piccadilly, where Félicie Dumarques’
marriage is no doubt recorded.’</p>

<p>This was unanswerable. Mr. Pullman looked
meditative, but said nothing.</p>

<p>‘And what is your motive for coming to me?’ he
asked at last.</p>

<p>‘I came here presuming that you, as Mr. Henry
Glenlyne’s solicitor, would be naturally desirous to
see his daughter righted.’</p>

<p>‘But suppose I should be disinclined to believe
in the parentage of this young lady, your protegée?’</p>

<p>‘My future wife, Mr. Pullman.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, I understand,’ returned the lawyer quickly,
as much as to say, ‘We are getting to the motive of
your conduct, my young gentleman.’</p>

<p>‘I have been engaged to Miss Glenlyne for nearly
a year,’ said Lucius, as if answering Mr. Pullman’s
degrading supposition, ‘but it is only within the last
week that I have discovered the secret of her parentage.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>‘Indeed; then whatever hope you may entertain
of future profit from this discovery is a recent hope,
and has had no influence in the matter of your regard
for this young lady?’</p>

<p>‘None whatever. I do not pretend to be superior
to human nature in general, but I think I may safely
say that there are few men who set less value on
money, in the abstract, than I do. But whatever
portion my wife may be entitled to receive I am ready
to fight for, and to fight still more resolutely for the
name which she is entitled to bear.’</p>

<p>‘But granted that the marriage which I hear of
for the first time to-day did actually take place, what
is to prove to any legal mind that this young lady
whom you put forward is the issue of that marriage?’</p>

<p>Yes, as Ferdinand Sivewright had said, here was
the weakness of the case. Lucius now for the first
time perceived that he ought to have secured the
dying man’s deposition of the facts concerning Lucille.
But, standing by that bed of pain, he had
hardly been in a condition to consider the case from
the lawyer’s standpoint. He had forgotten that Sivewright’s
statement was but fleeting breath, and that
this single witness of the truth was swiftly passing
beyond the jurisdiction of earthly tribunals.</p>

<p>‘For that we must rely on circumstantial evidence,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
he said after a longish pause. ‘The woman
who nursed Lucille Glenlyne may be still alive.’</p>

<p>‘How old was the child when this nurse left
her?’</p>

<p>‘About four, I believe.’</p>

<p>‘You believe!’ echoed Mr. Pullman contemptuously.
‘Before you approached me upon such a
subject as this, Mr. Davoren, you might at least
have taken the trouble to be certain about your facts.
You believe that the child was about four years
old when her nurse left her, and you rely upon this
nurse, who may or may not be living, to identify the
four-year-old child she nursed in the young lady of
nineteen whom you put forward.’</p>

<p>‘You are somewhat hard upon me, Mr. Pullman.’</p>

<p>‘Sir,’ said the lawyer, with a Johnsonian air, ‘I
abhor chimeras.’</p>

<p>‘I do not, however, despair of making Miss Glenlyne’s
identity clear even to your legal mind. As I
have told you, Mr. and Mrs. Glenlyne occupied a
cottage near Sidmouth for the few years of their
wedded life. The little girl was born there, nursed
there, and conveyed straight from that cottage to the
house in Bond-street, where she was brought up in
the care of old Mr. Sivewright. Now the date of
her removal from Sidmouth will fit into the date of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
her arrival in Bond-street, to which Mr. Sivewright
can testify; and it will go hard if we cannot find
people in Sidmouth—servants, tradesmen, the landlord
of the cottage—who will remember the child’s
abrupt removal and be able to swear to the date.’</p>

<p>‘Able to swear,’ exclaimed Mr. Pullman, again
contemptuous. ‘What fact is there so incredible
that legions of unimpeachable witnesses will not sustain
it by their testimony? You mentioned the name
of Sivewright just now. Is the person you spoke of
one Ferdinand Sivewright?’</p>

<p>‘No; the person in question is Ferdinand Sivewright’s
father.’</p>

<p>‘A pretty disreputable set, those Sivewrights, I
should think,’ said Mr. Pullman, ‘so far as I can judge
from the transactions between Ferdinand Sivewright
and my late client, Mr. Henry Glenlyne, which were
chiefly of the bill-discounting order.’</p>

<p>‘I have nothing to say in favour of Ferdinand
Sivewright, who died yesterday at the London Hospital,’
answered Lucius; ‘but his father is an honest
man, and it was his father who brought up Lucille,
knowing nothing more of her parentage than the
vague idea which he gathered from certain letters
written by Mr. Glenlyne.’</p>

<p>‘O, Ferdinand Sivewright is dead, is he?’ retorted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
Mr. Pullman, with a suspicious look; ‘and it
is only after his death that this claim arises.’</p>

<p>There was such an insolent doubt implied by
the lawyer’s words and manner that Lucius rose with
an offended look, and was about to leave Mr. Pullman’s
office.</p>

<p>‘You have chosen to discredit my statements,’
he said; ‘I can go to some other lawyer who will be
more civil and less suspicious.’</p>

<p>‘Stop, sir,’ cried Mr. Pullman, wheeling round
in his revolving chair as Lucius approached the
door. ‘I don’t say I won’t help you; I don’t say
your case is not a sound one; nor do I doubt your
good faith. Sit down again, and let us discuss the
matter quietly.’</p>

<p>‘I have endeavoured to do that, Mr. Pullman,
but you have chosen to adopt an offensive tone, and
the discussion is ended.’</p>

<p>‘Come, Mr. Davoren, why be so thin-skinned?
You come to me with a story which at the first
glance seems altogether incredible, and before I have
had time to weigh the facts or to recover my breath
after the surprise occasioned by your startling disclosure,
you take offence and wish me good-morning.
Go to another lawyer if you please; but if your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
case is a sound one, there is no one who can help
you so well as I.’</p>

<p>‘You are perhaps solicitor to some other branch
of the family—to people whose interests would be
injuriously affected by the assertion of Lucille Glenlyne’s
claims.’</p>

<p>‘No, Mr. Davoren. When Mr. Spalding Glenlyne
came into his cousin’s property, he chose to
employ another solicitor. My connection with the
Glenlyne family then terminated, except as concerns
Miss Glenlyne.’</p>

<p>‘Miss Glenlyne—who is that?’</p>

<p>‘Henry Glenlyne’s aunt. The sister of Mr. Reginald
Glenlyne, who left him his fortune.’</p>

<p>‘Is it possible that Miss Glenlyne is still living?’
exclaimed Lucius, remembering Monsieur Dolfe’s
description of the little elderly lady, thin, pale, and
an invalid. And this description had applied to her
twenty-two years ago. Miss Glenlyne must surely
belong to the Rosicrucians, or to the house of Methuselah.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ replied Mr. Pullman, ‘Miss Glenlyne is a
very old lady; between seventy and eighty, I daresay.’</p>

<p>‘But Miss Glenlyne was an invalid two-and-twenty
years ago.’</p>

<p>‘She was; and she has gone on being an invalid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
ever since; no more healthy mode of life. She lives
on mutton cutlets and sago puddings, dry toast and
weak tea, and if she indulges in a second glass of
dry sherry thinks it a debauch. She believes in the
homœopathists, and experimentalises upon her system
with minute doses, which, if they do her no
good, can hardly do her much harm. She spends her
winters at Nice or Dawlish, knows not the meaning
of emotion, and at the rate she lives—expenditure of
vital force reduced to the lowest figure—she may go
on living twenty-two years longer.’</p>

<p>‘If you have no relations with Mr. Spalding
Glenlyne, there is no reason why you should not
undertake to protect the interests of your late client’s
daughter,’ said Lucius. ‘I am quite ready to believe
that your knowledge of the family may render your
services better worth having than anybody else’s. I
came to you in perfect good faith, and in ignorance
of everything except the fact of Mr. Glenlyne’s marriage,
and the melancholy fate of his wife, who died
away from her husband and her child, as I have already
told you.’</p>

<p>‘A sad case for the lady,’ said the lawyer. ‘I
should like to see those letters, by the way, of which
you spoke a little while ago.’</p>

<p>‘I have brought them with me,’ answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
Lucius, producing the precious packet and the
miniature.</p>

<p>‘What, a picture?’ cried Mr. Pullman. ‘Yes;
that is my client’s portrait, undoubtedly, and a good
likeness. A very handsome young man, Henry Glenlyne,
but a weak one. Humph! These are the
letters, are they?’</p>

<p>The lawyer read them carefully, and from time
to time shook his head over them, with a slow and
meditative shake, as who should say, ‘These are poor
stuff.’</p>

<p>‘There is very little to help your case here,’ he
said, when he had finished this deliberate perusal.
‘The child is spoken of as <em>your little girl</em>, or <em>the
little girl</em>, throughout. The most rational conclusion
would be that the child was Sivewright’s child.’</p>

<p>‘Yet in that case why should Mr. Glenlyne, a
young man about town, be interested in the child?
Why should he give money? Why should he supplicate
for secrecy?’</p>

<p>‘Matter for philosophical speculation, but hardly
a question to submit to a jury, or put in an affidavit,’
replied Mr. Pullman coolly.</p>

<p>‘If there is nothing in those letters to help me,
I will find the evidence I want elsewhere,’ said
Lucius, inwardly fuming at this graybeard’s impenetrability.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
‘I will go down myself to Sidmouth—hunt
out the landlord of that cottage.’</p>

<p>‘Of whose very name you are ignorant,’ interposed
the man of business.</p>

<p>‘Find the servant; advertise for the nurse; discover
the doctor who attended Mrs. Glenlyne when
that child was born; and link by link forge the chain
of evidence which shall reinstate Lucille Glenlyne in
the name her cowardly father stole from her.’</p>

<p>‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De mortuis</i>,’ said the lawyer. ‘I admit that if
your idea—mind, I fully believe in your own good
faith, but you may be mistaken for all that—if
your idea is correct, I repeat this girl has been
badly treated. But my client is in his grave; let us
make what excuses we can for conduct that at first
sight appears unmanly.’</p>

<p>‘I can make no excuse for a man who repudiated
his child; who suffered his wife to die broken-hearted,
lest by a manly avowal of his marriage he should
hazard the loss of fortune.’</p>

<p>‘Recollect that Henry Glenlyne was brought up
and educated in the expectation of his uncle’s fortune,
that he was deeply in debt for some years
before his uncle died, and that the forfeiture of that
fortune would have been absolute ruin.’</p>

<p>‘It was a large fortune, I suppose?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>

<p>‘It was a fortune that would have been counted
large when I was a youngster, but which now might
be called mediocre. It was under rather than over a
hundred thousand pounds, and chiefly invested in
land. Reginald Glenlyne had been in the Indian
Civil Service when the pagoda-tree was better worth
shaking than it is nowadays, and in a lengthened
career had contrived to do pretty well for himself.
He belonged to an old family, and a rich one, and
had started in life with a competence.’</p>

<p>‘Henry Glenlyne did inherit this fortune, I conclude?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, though the Spalding Glenlynes ran him
hard for it.’</p>

<p>‘How long did he survive his uncle?’</p>

<p>‘Nearly ten years. He married a year after the
old man’s death—married a fashionable woman,
handsome, extravagant, and it was whispered a bit of
a tartar. She brought him two sons and a daughter,
who all died—a taint of consumption in the blood,
people said; and the lady herself died of rapid consumption
two years before her husband. The loss of
wife and children broke him up altogether; and Joseph
Spalding Glenlyne, who had watched the estate
like a harpy ever since he left Cambridge, had the
satisfaction of coming into possession of it after all.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span></p>

<p>‘Did Henry Glenlyne make a will?’</p>

<p>‘No; he died suddenly, though his constitution
had been broken for some time before the end.
Joseph Glenlyne inherited under the uncle’s will.’</p>

<p>‘And that left the estate—’</p>

<p>‘To Henry Glenlyne, and his children after him.
Failing such issue, to Joseph Spalding Glenlyne,
and his children after him. Mr. Spalding Glenlyne
has plenty of children—raw-boned boys, who prowl
about Westminster between school-hours with their
luncheons in blue bags. A saving man, Mr. Glenlyne.
I have seen his boys in the abbey itself
munching surreptitious sandwiches.’</p>

<p>‘Then this estate now held by Mr. Spalding
Glenlyne actually belongs of right to Lucille.’</p>

<p>‘If you can prove her to be the legitimate daughter
of Henry Glenlyne, she is most decidedly entitled
to claim it.’</p>

<p>‘If I cannot prove that, I must be unworthy of
success in any walk of life,’ said Lucius.</p>

<p>‘Leave the case in my hands, Mr. Davoren, and
leave me those letters. My clerk shall make copies
of them if you like, and return you the original documents.
I’ll think the matter over, and, if I find it
ripe enough, take counsel’s opinion.’</p>

<p>‘I should like to see Miss Glenlyne—the lady in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
whose service Lucille’s mother came to England,’
said Lucius. ‘Would there be any harm in my
endeavouring to obtain an interview with her?’</p>

<p>‘I think not. Old Miss Glenlyne hates the
Spalding Glenlynes worse than she hates allopathy.
They contrived to offend her in some unpardonable
manner while they were courting her brother. She
is at Brighton just now. If you would really like to
call upon her, I shouldn’t mind giving you a letter
of introduction. She and I were always good
friends.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll go down to Brighton to-morrow, and take
Lucille with me. She is wonderfully like that portrait
of Félicie Dumarques, and it will be strange if
Miss Glenlyne fails to see the likeness, unless age
has darkened “those that look out of the windows.”’</p>

<p>‘Miss Glenlyne is as sharp as a needle—a wonderful
old lady.’</p>

<p>Mr. Pullman, who had now, as it were, taken
Lucius under his wing, wrote a letter of introduction,
stating Mr. Davoren’s motive for seeking an interview,
addressed his note to Miss Glenlyne, Selbrook-place,
and handed it to his new client. And thus
they parted, on excellent terms with each other, the
lawyer promising to send a clerk to inspect the St.
James’s registries that afternoon, in quest of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
particular entry which was in a manner the keystone
of Lucille’s case.</p>

<p>‘Upon my word, I don’t know why I should be fool
enough to take up such a chimerical business,’ Mr.
Pullman said to himself, half reproachfully, as he
stood upon his hearthrug, and enjoyed the genial
warmth of his seacoal fire, after Lucius had left him.</p>

<p>But in his heart of hearts Mr. Pullman was
pretty well aware that he took up Lucius and Lucille’s
case because he detested Joseph Spalding Glenlyne.</p>

<p>Lord Lytton has written an admirable chapter
upon the value of Hate as a motive power, and it
was assuredly Hate that prompted Mr. Pullman to
undertake the championship of Lucille. Mr. Spalding
Glenlyne had removed the Glenlyne estate from
Mr. Pullman’s office. The poetry of retribution
would be achieved by the return of the estate to the
office without the encumbrance of Spalding Glenlyne.</p>

<p>Mr. Pullman polished his spectacles with his
oriental handkerchief, and sighed gently to himself
as he thought what a nice thing that would be.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE END OF ALL DELUSIONS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Mr. Sivewright</span> received the news of his son’s
death like a Roman; yet Lucius felt that beneath
this semblance of stoicism there lurked keenest pain.
With weak human nature’s inconsistency the old
man’s memory now slid back to days long gone,
before his son had become a scorpion—when the
clever bright-faced child had seemed the one star of
hope upon a joyless horizon.</p>

<p>‘He was such a promising child,’ Homer Sivewright
said to himself, as he sat by the hearth in the
panelled parlour, absorbed in gloomy meditation,
‘and I hoped so much from him. How was it that
he went astray? Was it innate wickedness, or his
mother’s evil teaching?’</p>

<p>One pang was spared him. He did not know
that the son he had once so fondly loved had tried
to sap the last dregs of his failing life by slow poison.
He knew that Ferdinand was a baffled murderer, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
he had seen the knife pointed at his own breast by
that relentless hand. But he might extenuate even
this deadly assault by supposing it to be unpremeditated—a
sudden access of ungovernable rage.
So he sat by his hearth, and brooded upon days so
long vanished that it seemed almost as if they belonged
to another life; as if the chief figure in those
departed scenes—himself—had been a different
person, and had died long ago, so utterly had he
outgrown and passed away from the Homer Sivewright
of that time. He thought with a new and
keen regret of a period that had been sorely troubled,
yet not without hope. His busy brain had been full
of schemes of self-aggrandisement—the dulness of
the present brightened by one perpetual day-dream,
the vision of accumulated wealth, which he and his
only son were to share. The boy’s good looks and
talent had promised success. He seemed born to
conquer—to trample on the necks of less-gifted mankind.
Delusive dreams—baseless calculations! Between
that time and this lay the dark world of
memory, peopled with the phantoms of dead hopes.</p>

<p>The old man sighed at the thought that he had
outlived the possibility of hope. He was too old to
look forward, except beyond the grave; and his eyes,
so keen for the business of this world, were yet too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
dull to pierce the mists that veil Death’s fatal river,
and reach the shore that lies upon the other side.
What hold had he now upon the things of this earth—toil
and profit, and the strong wine of success?
He, who had once been whole owner of the good ship
Life, was now reduced to a sixty-fourth share in that
gallant vessel. What recked it to him where she
drifted or against what rock she perished, now his
interest in her was so small? To think of the future—that
earthly future which alone presented itself
to his too mundane mind—was to think of a time
in which he must cease to be. He could not easily
transfer his hopes to those who were to succeed him;
those who might perchance reap the fruit of his unwearying
toil. He thought of all the miles—the
stony London miles—that he had walked in pursuit
of his trade—often with tired feet. He thought of
that stern system of deprivation he had imposed on
himself, till he had schooled his appetite to habitual
self-denial, brought the demon sense into subjection
so complete that it was as if he had been created
without the longings of other men. How many a
time had he passed through the savoury steam of
some popular dining-place, while hunger gnawed his
entrails! On how many a bitter day he had refused
himself the modest portion of strong drink which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
might have comforted him after his weary wanderings!
He had denied himself all the things that
other men deem necessities—had denied himself with
money in his pockets—and had amassed his collection.
To-day he was unusually disposed to gloomy thought,
and began even to doubt whether the collection was
worth the life of deprivation it had cost him. He
had been gradually recovering health and strength
for some time, but with convalescence came a
curiously depressed state of mind. He was not
strong enough to go about his business—to potter
about as of old amidst the chaos of his various
treasures, to resume the compilation of an elaborate
descriptive catalogue, at which he had been slowly
working since his removal to Cedar House. Nor
could he think of reinspecting his miscellaneous
possessions without a pang, lest, in doing so, he
should find even greater loss than he was now aware
of. So, powerless to seek consolation from a return
to business and activity, he sat by his fireside in the
gloomy October weather, and brooded over the past.</p>

<p>Lucille tended him as of old, with the same unvarying
patience and affection.</p>

<p>‘It is such a happiness to see you looking so
much better, dear grandfather,’ she said, as she stood
beside him while he ate his noontide mutton-chop, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
simple fare which seemed particularly savoury after
that diet of broths and jellies to which he had been
kept so long.</p>

<p>‘Looking better am I?’ muttered Mr. Sivewright
testily. ‘Then I wonder what kind of a spectre I
looked when I was worse—Ugolino in a black-velvet
skull-cap, I suppose. I tried to shave myself this
morning, and the face I saw in the glass was ghostly
enough in all conscience. However, Lucius says I’m
better, and you say I’m better; so I suppose I am
better.’</p>

<p>‘Lucius thinks we might all go to the country
for a little while for change of air,’ said Lucille,
‘that is to say, you and I, and Lucius would be with
us part of the time—just for a day or two—it’s so
difficult for him to leave his patients. He says
change of air would do you so much good.’</p>

<p>‘Does he indeed!’ exclaimed Mr. Sivewright, with
an ironical air; ‘and pray who is to take care of my
collection if I leave it? It has been robbed enough
as it is.’</p>

<p>‘But, dear grandfather,’ remonstrated Lucille,
‘is not your health of more consequence than those
things, however valuable they may be?’</p>

<p>‘No, child; for to gather those things together I
sacrificed all that other men call ease. Am I to lose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
the fruit of a lifetime? It is hard enough to be robbed
of any portion of it. Let me keep what remains. I
shall have no more rest till I am able to go through
my catalogue, and see how much I have lost.’</p>

<p>‘Could not I do that?’</p>

<p>‘No, Lucille; no one knows the things properly
except myself. Wincher knew a good deal, for I was
weak enough to trust him fully. He knew what I paid
for everything, and the value I set upon it. He was
the only man I ever trusted after my son deceived
me; and you see my reward. He took advantage of
my helplessness to betray me.’</p>

<p>Lucille gave a little choking sigh. She felt that
the time had come for her to speak. That poor faithful
old servant must no longer appear despicable in
the eyes of the master he had served so well. She
must make her confession to her grandfather as she
had made it to Lucius.</p>

<p>‘I wish Lucius were here to speak for me,’ she
thought; and then, ashamed of this moral cowardice,
she knelt down beside Homer Sivewright’s chair, and
took his hand in hers timidly, hardly knowing how
to begin.</p>

<p>‘I’m not angry with you, child,’ he said gently,
interpreting that timid clinging touch as a remonstrance.
‘You have been true and faithful. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
women are like dogs in the fidelity of their attachments.
One hardly counts them when one considers
the baseness of mankind.’</p>

<p>‘O grandfather, I have not been quite faithful.
I meant to do what was right—only—only I obeyed
my heart, and wavered from the strict line of duty.
It was my fault that you were robbed.’</p>

<p>‘Your fault? Nonsense, child! That poor little
head of yours isn’t right yet, or you would not talk so.’</p>

<p>‘It is the truth, grandpapa,’ said Lucille, and then
told her story—told how the wanderer had pleaded,
and how, touched by his houselessness and seeming
destitution, she had admitted him in secret to the
shelter of his father’s roof.</p>

<p>The old man listened with sublime patience.
Another evidence of how vile a thing was this dead
son, whom he had mourned with that strange unreasoning
tenderness which death will awaken in the
coldest hearts.</p>

<p>‘Say no more, child,’ he said gently, when Lucille
had pleaded for pardon almost as if the wrong done
by Ferdinand Sivewright had been wholly hers.
‘You were foolish and loving, and pitied him and
trusted him, although I had often warned you that
he was of all men most unworthy of pity or trust.
Don’t cry, Lucille; I’m not angry with you. Perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
I might have been persuaded to believe in him
myself if he had pleaded long enough. That tongue
of his was subtle as the serpent’s. And so it was my
son who robbed me! He crept into my house in
secret, and used his first opportunity to plunder. He
is dead; let us forget him. The tenderest mercy
God and man could show him would be oblivion.’</p>

<p>And from this hour Homer Sivewright spoke of
his son no more.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Once</span> assured that there was no blot upon Lucille’s
parentage, Lucius had no longer any motive for
withholding the result of his researches from her
whom they most nearly concerned. He spent his
evening at Cedar House, as usual, on the day of his
interview with Mr. Pullman; and after tea, when
Mr. Sivewright had retired, seized the opportunity
to show Lucille the little packet of letters, and to
relate his adventures at Rouen and in Paris. Lucille
wept many tears as that story of the past was
slowly unfolded to her—wept for the sorrows of the
mother she vaguely remembered watching like a
guardian angel beside her little bed.</p>

<p>‘Dear mother! and to think that in your brief
life there was so much sorrow!’ she said mournfully.</p>

<p>Her father—as revealed to her by those letters,
and by all that Lucius told her—seemed worldly and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
even cruel. He had suffered his young wife to fade
and die in severance from all she loved. For the
sake of what?—his uncle’s fortune. He had acted a
lie rather than forego that worldly gain. O foolish
dream of a father’s love! From first to last it had
been only a delusion for Lucille. She uttered no
word of reproach against the dead. But she separated
her mother’s letters from the others in the
little packet, and asked if she might keep them.</p>

<p>‘These and the miniature are the only memorials
of the mother I lost so soon,’ she said. ‘They are
very precious to me.’</p>

<p>‘Keep them, dearest, but do not cultivate sad
memories. Your life has been too long clouded;
but, please God, there shall be less shadow than sunshine
henceforward.’</p>

<p>He told Lucille of his idea of taking her to
Brighton in a day or two, to see Miss Glenlyne.</p>

<p>‘The lady with whom my mother came to England,’
she said. ‘Yes, I should very much like to
see any one who knew my mother.’</p>

<p>‘We will go the day after to-morrow, then, dear,
if grandpapa will give us permission. We can come
back to town the same evening, and Janet can go
with us to play propriety, if you like.’</p>

<p>‘I should like that very much,’ said Lucille.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Sivewright was consulted when Lucius paid
his visit next morning; and, on being told the circumstances
of the case fully, was tolerably complaisant.
He was still ‘grandpapa’—nobody had
any idea of deposing him from the sway and masterdom
that went along with that title.</p>

<p>‘I suppose you must take her,’ he said reluctantly,
‘though the house seems miserable without her.
Such a quiet little thing as she is too! I couldn’t
have believed her absence would make so much difference.
But if you’re going to establish her claim
to a fine fortune, I suppose I shall soon lose her.
Miss Glenlyne will be ashamed of the old bric-à-brac
dealer.’</p>

<p>‘Ashamed of you, grandpapa,’ cried Lucille, ‘when
you’ve taken care of me all these years, and educated
me, and paid for everything I’ve ever had!’</p>

<p>‘Taken care!’ repeated Mr. Sivewright with a
sigh. ‘I believe the care has been on the other side.
You’ve brightened my home, little girl, and crept
into my heart unawares, though I tried my hardest
to keep it shut against you.’</p>

<p>Lucille rewarded this unusual burst of tenderness
with a kiss, to which the cynic submitted with assumed
reluctance.</p>

<p>They went to Brighton by an early train next day,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
accompanied by Janet, who had consented to stay for
a few days in her brother’s unlovely abode, before
going back to Flossie. That idolised damsel had
been left to the care of old nurse Sally, who guarded
her as the apple of her eye.</p>

<p>It was pleasant weather for a hasty trip to
Brighton. The rush and riot of excursion-trains
had ended with the ending of summer. Lucius and
his two companions left London-bridge terminus
comfortably and quietly in a quick train, with a carriage
to themselves. The day was bright and sunny;
the deepening tints of autumn beautified the peaceful
landscape; the air blew fresh and strong across the
downs as the train neared Brighton.</p>

<p>Janet sat in her corner of the carriage grave and
somewhat silent, while the others talked in low confidential
tones of the past and the future. Where
love is firm hope is never absent, what shadow soever
may obscure life’s horizon. Lucius and Lucille,
happy in each other’s society, forgot all the troubles
and perplexities of the last few months. But Janet
had not yet recovered from the shock of that meeting
in the hospital. She was still haunted by the last
look of her husband’s dying eyes.</p>

<p>They arrived at Brighton before noon, at too
early an hour for a first visit to an elderly lady like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
Miss Glenlyne. So they walked up and down the
Parade for an hour or so, looking at the sea and talking
of all manner of things. Janet brightened a
good deal during this walk, and seemed pleased to
discuss her brother’s future, though she studiously
avoided any allusion to her own.</p>

<p>‘You must not go and bury yourself at Stillmington
again, Janet; must she, Lucille?’ Lucius said by
and by. ‘The place is nice enough—much nicer than
London, I daresay; but we want you to be near us.’</p>

<p>‘Shall I come back to London?’ asked Janet.
‘I daresay I could get some teaching in town. The
publishers would recommend me. Yes, it would be
nice to be near you, Lucius, to play our old concertante
duets again. It would seem like the dear
old days when—’ She could not finish the sentence.
The thought of the father and mother whose death
had perhaps been hastened by her folly was too
bitter. Happily for her own peace Janet never knew
how deep the wounds she had inflicted on those
faithful hearts. She knew that they were lost to
her—that she had not been by to ask a blessing
from those dying lips. But the full measure of her
guilt she knew not.</p>

<p>‘Yes, Janet, you must settle in London. I shall
move to the West-end very soon. I feel myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
strong enough to create a practice, if I cannot afford
to buy one. And then we can see each other constantly.’</p>

<p>‘I will come, then,’ answered Janet quietly.</p>

<p>She seemed to have no thought of any other
future than that which her own industry was to provide
for her.</p>

<p>They left the sea soon after this, and took a light
luncheon of tea and cakes at a confectioner’s in the
Western-road, prior to descending upon Selbrook-place,
to find the abode of Miss Glenlyne. Janet
was to sit upon the Parade, or walk about and amuse
herself as she liked, while Lucius and Lucille were
with Miss Glenlyne, and they were to meet afterwards
at a certain seat by the lawn. It was just possible,
of course, that there might be some disappointment—that
Miss Glenlyne, elderly and invalided
though she was, might be out, or that she might
refuse to see them in spite of Mr. Pullman’s letter.</p>

<p>‘But I don’t feel as if we were going to be disappointed,’
said Lucius; ‘I have a notion that we shall
succeed.’</p>

<p>They left Janet to her own devices, and went arm-in-arm
to Selbrook-place. It was an eminently quiet
place, consisting of two rows of modern houses,
stuccoed, pseudo-classical, and commonplace, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
an ornamental garden between them. The garden
was narrow, and the shady side of Selbrook-place was
very shady. No intrusive fly or vehemently driven
cart could violate the aristocratic seclusion of Selbrook-place.
The houses were accessible only in the
rear. They turned their backs, as it were, upon the
vulgar commerce of life, and in a manner ignored it.
That garden, where few flowers flourished, was common
to the occupants of Selbrook-place, but shut
against the outer world. The inhabitants could descend
from their French windows to that sacred parterre,
but to the outer world those French windows
were impenetrable.</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that Selbrook-place was for
the most part affected by elderly ladies, maiden or
widowed, without encumbrance, by spinster sisters
of doubtful age, by gouty old gentlemen who over-ate
themselves and over-drank themselves in the respectable
seclusion of dining-rooms, unexposed to the vulgar
gaze. There was much talk about eating and
drinking, servants, and wills, in Selbrook-place. Every
inhabitant of those six-and-twenty respectable houses
knew all about his or her neighbours’ intentions as
to the ultimate disposal of their property. That property
question was an inexhaustible subject of conversation.
Every one in Selbrook-place seemed amply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
provided with the goods of this world, and those
who lived in the profoundest solitude and spent least
money were reputed the richest. Miss Glenlyne was
one of these. She never gave a dinner or a cup of
tea to neighbour or friend; she wore shabby garments,
and went out in a hired bath-chair, attended
by a confidential maid or companion, who was just a
shade shabbier than herself. The gradation was
almost imperceptible, for the maid wore out the
mistress’s clothes—clothes that had not been new
within the memory of any one in Selbrook-place.
Miss Glenlyne had brought a voluminous wardrobe to
Brighton twenty years ago, and appeared to have
been gradually wearing out that handsome supply of
garments, so little concession did she make to the
mutations of taste.</p>

<p>A maid-servant opened the door—a maid-servant
attired with scrupulous neatness in the lavender cotton
gown and frilled muslin cap which have become
traditional. To this maid Lucius gave Mr. Pullman’s
letter and his own card, saying that he would wait to
know if Miss Glenlyne would be so good as to see
him.</p>

<p>The maid looked embarrassed, evidently thoughtful
of the spoons, which doubtless lurked somewhere
in the dim religious light of a small pantry, at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
end of the passage. After a moment’s hesitation she
rang a call-bell, and kept her eye on Lucius and
Lucille until the summons was answered.</p>

<p>It was answered quickly by an elderly person in
a black silk gown, in which time had developed a
mellow green tinge and to which friction had given a
fine gloss. This person, who wore a bugled black
lace cap, rather on one side, was Miss Spilling,
once Miss Glenlyne’s maid, now elevated to a middle
station, half servant, half companion—servant to be
ordered about, companion to sympathise.</p>

<p>‘I have a letter of introduction to Miss Glenlyne,
from Mr. Pullman of Lincoln’s-inn,’ said Lucius.</p>

<p>‘Dear me!’ exclaimed Miss Spilling; ‘Mr. Pullman
ought to know that Miss Glenlyne objects to receive
any one, above all a stranger. She is a great
invalid. Mr. Pullman ought to know better than to
give letters of introduction without Miss Glenlyne’s
permission.’</p>

<p>‘The matter is one of importance,’ said Lucius,
‘or I should not have troubled Miss Glenlyne.’</p>

<p>Miss Spilling surveyed him doubtfully from head
to foot. He wore good clothes certainly, and looked
like a gentleman. But then appearances are deceptive.
He might be a genteel beggar after all. There
are so many vicarious beggars, people who beg for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
other people, for new churches, and missions, and
schools; people who seem to beg for the sake of
begging. And Miss Glenlyne, though she subscribed
handsomely to a certain number of orthodox old-established
charities, hated to be pestered on behalf of
novel schemes for the benefit of her fellow creatures.</p>

<p>‘If it’s anything connected with ritualism,’ said
Miss Spilling, ‘it isn’t the least use for me to take
your letter up to Miss Glenlyne. Her principles are
strictly evangelical.’</p>

<p>‘My business has nothing to do with ritualism.
Pray let Miss Glenlyne read the letter.’</p>

<p>Miss Spilling sighed doubtfully, looked at the
maid as much as to say, ‘Keep your eye on these
people,’ and went up-stairs with the letter, leaving
Lucius and Lucille standing in the hall.</p>

<p>She returned in about ten minutes with a surprised
air, and requested them to walk up to the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>They followed her to the first floor, where she
ushered them into a room crowded with much unnecessary
furniture, darkened by voluminous curtains,
and heated like the palm-house in Kew Gardens.
Lucius felt a sense of oppression directly he entered
the apartment. The windows were all shut, a bright
fire burned in a shining steel grate, which reflected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
its glow, and a curious Indian perfume filled the room.
In a capacious chair by the fire reclined a little old
lady, wrapped in an Indian shawl of dingy hues, a little
old lady whose elaborate blonde cap was almost as
big as all the rest of her person. Her slender hands,
on whose waxen skin the blue veins stood out prominently,
were embellished with valuable old diamond
rings in silver setting, and an ancient diamond
brooch in the shape of a feather clasped the shawl
across her shrunken shoulders.</p>

<p>This old lady was Miss Glenlyne. She raised her
eye-glass with tremulous fingers, and surveyed her
visitors with a somewhat parrot-like scrutiny. The
contour of her aristocratic features was altogether of
the parrot order.</p>

<p>‘Come here,’ she said, addressing Lucille, with
kindly command,—‘come here, and sit by my side;
and you, sir, pray what is the meaning of this curious
story which Mr. Pullman tells me? Spilling, you
can go, my dear.’</p>

<p>Miss Spilling had lingered, anxious to know all
about these strangers. Every day made Miss Spilling
more and more solicitous upon the all-important
question of Miss Glenlyne’s will. She had reason
to suppose that her interests were cared for in that
document. But advancing age did not increase Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
Glenlyne’s wisdom. Some base intruder, arriving
late upon the scene, might undo the slow work of
years, and thrust himself between Miss Glenlyne’s
legitimate heirs and their heritage. Just as a
horse which has been kept well in hand in the early
part of a race comes in with a rush as winner at the
finish. In the presence of these unknown intruders
Miss Spilling scented danger.</p>

<p>She ignored her mistress’s behest, and came over
to the easy-chair, moved a little table near it, picked
up a fallen newspaper, and hovered over Miss Glenlyne
with tenderest solicitude.</p>

<p>‘It’s just upon the time for your chicken broth,’
she said.</p>

<p>‘My chicken broth can wait until I require it,’
replied Miss Glenlyne curtly. ‘You can go, my dear;
I want a little private talk with this lady and gentleman.’</p>

<p>Miss Spilling retired meekly, but troubled of
heart. There is nothing easier than to alter a will.
Yet Miss Spilling felt it was wisest to obey. Surely
the patient service of years was not to be set at
naught for some new fancy. But age is apt to be
capricious, fickle even; and Miss Spilling was not
blind to the fact that there were seasons when Miss
Glenlyne considered her a bore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span></p>

<p>‘You are not so amusing as you were fifteen
years ago, Spilling,’ Miss Glenlyne would sometimes
remark candidly; and Miss Spilling could but admit
that fifteen years of a solitude scarcely less profound
than the loneliness of a Carthusian monastery had
not tended to enliven her spirits. She had come
to Miss Glenlyne charged with all the gossip
picked up in a half a dozen previous situations, and
little by little she had exhausted her fund of frivolity
and slander, and told her servants’-hall stories till
they were threadbare.</p>

<p>Who could be sure that Miss Glenlyne would not
be beguiled by some new favourite, even at the very
end of her career? Sedulously had Miss Spilling
striven to guard against this ever-present peril by
keeping poor relations, old friends, and strangers
alike at bay. But to-day she felt herself worsted, and
retired to her own apartment depressed and apprehensive.
If the folding-doors had been closed she might
have gone into the back drawing-room and listened;
but the folding-doors were open. Miss Glenlyne
liked a palm-house atmosphere, but she liked space
for an occasional constitutional promenade, so the
back drawing-room was never shut off. Miss Spilling
lingered a little by the landing door, but heard
only indistinct murmurs, and feared to loiter long,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
lest she should be caught in the act by the parlourmaid
Susan, who was fleet of foot.</p>

<p>‘This is a very curious story,’ said Miss Glenlyne,
when the door had closed upon her companion;
‘I hardly know how to believe it. A marriage between
my nephew Henry and Félicie Dumarques! It
seems hardly credible.’</p>

<p>‘The record in the parish register proves it to be
a fact nevertheless,’ said Lucius quietly.</p>

<p>‘So Mr. Pullman tells me. Félicie left me to go
to Rouen, she said, summoned home by illness in her
family. And now it seems she stole away to marry my
nephew. She must have been an artful treacherous girl.’</p>

<p>Lucille rose hastily from her seat near Miss Glenlyne.
‘You forget, Miss Glenlyne, that she was my
mother,’ she said firmly; ‘I cannot stay to hear her
condemned.’</p>

<p>‘Nonsense, child,’ cried the old lady, not unkindly;
‘sit down. The truth must be told even if
she was your mother. She treated me very badly. I
was so fond of that girl. She was the only person I
ever had about me who suited me thoroughly. She
would have been amply provided for after my death
if she had stayed and been faithful to me. I never
treated her as a servant, or thought of her as a servant;
indeed it would have been difficult for any one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
to do so, for she had the manners and instincts
of a lady. Yet she deceived me, and left me with
a lie.’</p>

<p>‘Love is a powerful influence,’ said Lucille
softly; ‘she was persuaded to that wrong act by one
she fondly loved, one for whom she willingly sacrificed
her own happiness, and who rewarded her at
the last by desertion.’</p>

<p>‘My nephew was always selfish,’ said Miss Glenlyne;
‘he was brought up by a foolish mother, who
taught him to count upon inheriting his uncle’s
money, and never taught him any higher duty than
to seek his own pleasure, so far as he could gratify
himself without offending his uncle. She taught
him to flatter and tell lies before he could speak
plain. He was not altogether bad, and might have
been a much better man if he had been differently
trained. Well, well, I daresay he was most to blame
throughout the business. I’ll say no more against
poor Félicie; only it was not kind of her to leave an
invalid mistress who had shown her a good deal of
affection.’</p>

<p>‘Whatever error she committed she suffered
deeply for it,’ said Lucille. ‘The sin was chiefly
another’s, but the sorrow was all hers.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, my dear, that’s the usual distribution between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
a man and a woman,’ replied Miss Glenlyne,
considerably softened by this time.</p>

<p>She turned and scrutinised Lucille’s candid countenance—took
the pale interesting face between her
hands and held it near her.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ she said at last, ‘you have Félicie’s eyes
and Félicie’s mouth. I can readily believe that you
are her daughter. And pray, Mr. Davoren, what is
your interest in this young lady?’</p>

<p>‘We are engaged to be married,’ answered Lucius.</p>

<p>‘Indeed! Not in an underhand way, I hope, like
Félicie and my nephew, who must have been making
love by some secret code before my very face, when
I hadn’t a suspicion of any such thing.’</p>

<p>‘We are engaged with the full consent of Lucille’s
adopted father—her only friend,’ answered
Lucius.</p>

<p>‘I am glad of that. And what put it into your
head to come to me?’</p>

<p>‘Because I thought you might be able to assist
Lucille in establishing her claim to any heritage to
which she may be entitled.’</p>

<p>‘If she is the legitimate and only child of Henry
Glenlyne, she is entitled to a very fine estate, which
is now enjoyed by a man my brother never intended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
to benefit by it. He was doatingly fond of his brother’s
son Henry; and although the young man disappointed
him in many things, that love was never
seriously diminished. He left Henry the bulk of
his fortune, with reversion to any child or children
that might be born to him. He knew that I had
an income more than enough for my wants, so he
left almost all to his nephew. Spalding Glenlyne’s
name was put in at the suggestion of Mr. Pullman,
but it was never supposed that he would inherit the
estate.’</p>

<p>Once set going, Miss Glenlyne was quite willing
to relate all she could remember about her brother
Reginald, her nephew Henry, and Félicie Dumarques.
She spoke of the Spalding Glenlynes with rancour,
and declared her readiness to assist Lucille, so far
as lay in her power, in the assertion of her claim to
the Glenlyne estate, which consisted of various lands
and tenements in Norfolk, and though yielding the
usual low rate of interest, produced between three
and four thousand a year.</p>

<p>Before taking her chicken-broth, Miss Glenlyne
ordered an impromptu dinner of mutton-chops to be
prepared for her visitors, and, when Lucius mentioned
his sister Janet as a reason for declining this
proffered hospitality, insisted that he should go instantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
and fetch that young lady. Lucius dutifully
obeyed, and while he was gone Miss Glenlyne opened
her heart more and more to Lucille, moved by the
recollection of that gentle girl who had ministered to
her frivolous and innumerable wants with such unwearying
solicitude.</p>

<p>‘It makes me feel twenty years younger to have
you with me,’ said the old lady. ‘I like young faces
and pretty looks and gentle manners. Spilling, my
maid, whom you saw just now, is good and devoted,
but she is elderly and uncultivated and not pleasant
to look at. She knows I like quiet, of course, at my
age and with my weak health. I have had bad health
all my life, my dear; quiet is essential. But Spilling
is over-anxious on this point, and keeps every one
away from me. I am shut up in this drawing-room
like a jewel that is kept in cotton-wool and never
taken out to be worn. Spilling is extremely attentive—never
lets my fire get low, or forgets the correct
time for my beef-tea and chicken-broth. But I
feel the solitude depressing sometimes. A little
youthful society, a little music, would be quite cheering.
You play and sing now, I daresay?’</p>

<p>‘Very little, though I am fond of music,’ answered
Lucille; ‘but Janet, Mr. Davoren’s sister, sings
beautifully.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span></p>

<p>‘I should like to hear her. Félicie used to sing
to me of an evening, while I sat in the dusk to save
my poor eyes, such pretty simple French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chansons</i>.
How I wish you could come here and stay, with me!’</p>

<p>‘You are very kind to think of it, Miss Glenlyne,’
answered Lucille, thinking what a curious life it
would be with this old lady, who seemed half a century
older than the energetic unconquerable Homer
Sivewright, ‘but I’m afraid I couldn’t leave my
grandfather.’</p>

<p>‘Your grandfather?’</p>

<p>‘He is not really my grandfather, though I believed
that he was till very lately; but he has been
good to me and brought me up. I owe him everything.’</p>

<p>Miss Glenlyne questioned Lucille a good deal
about her past life, its early years and so on, and
seemed warmly interested. She was not an old lady
who poured out her spare affections upon more or less
deserving members of the animal kingdom, and she
had been of late years almost cut off from communion
with humanity. Her heart opened unawares to receive
Lucille.</p>

<p>‘If you are my nephew’s daughter, it stands to
reason that I am your great-aunt,’ she said; ‘and I
shall expect you to pay me some duty. You must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
come to stay with me as soon as this adopted grandfather
is well enough to do without you.’</p>

<p>‘Dear Miss Glenlyne, I shall be most happy to
come. I am more glad than I can tell you to find
some one who is really related to me.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t call me Miss Glenlyne, then, but Aunt
Glenlyne,’ said the old lady authoritatively.</p>

<p>Miss Spilling felt as if she could have fallen to
the ground in a swoon when she came into the drawing-room
five minutes afterwards and heard the
strange young person call her mistress ‘Aunt Glenlyne.’</p>

<p>‘How you stare, Spilling!’ cried the old lady.
‘This young lady is my grandniece, Miss Lucille
Glenlyne.’</p>

<p>After this Spilling stared with almost apoplectic
intensity of gaze.</p>

<p>‘Lor, Miss Glenlyne, that must be one of your
jokes,’ she exclaimed. ‘You wouldn’t call one of
the Spalding Glenlynes your niece, and I know you’ve
no other.’</p>

<p>‘I never make jokes,’ answered her mistress with
dignity; ‘and I beg that you will show Miss Lucille
Glenlyne all possible respect, now, and on every
other occasion. I have ordered a hurried dinner to
be prepared for Miss Lucille and her friends, who, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
am sorry to say, have to return to London this evening.
They will dine in the back drawing-room, so
that I may take my own simple meal with them.’</p>

<p>Miss Spilling felt as if the universe had suddenly
begun to crumble around her. Her hold upon that
sense of identity which sustains mankind amidst the
mysteries of an unexplainable world seemed to waver.
Dinner ordered and without prior consultation with
her—a new era of waste and rioting set in while her
back was turned! She fumbled in an ancient beaded
reticule, produced a green glass bottle of weak salts,
and sniffed vehemently.</p>

<p>‘Sit down, and be quiet, Spilling,’ said Miss
Glenlyne. ‘I daresay you and my niece will get on
very well together. And her arrival won’t make any
difference in what I intended to do for you.’</p>

<p>‘What I intended to do,’ sounded vague. Miss
Spilling had hoped the intention was long ago set
down in black and white—made as much a fact as it
could be before Miss Glenlyne’s decease. She gave
another sniff at her salts-bottle, and sat down, meek
but not hopeful. This liking for youthful faces was
one of her employer’s weaknesses, against which she
had brought to bear all the art she knew. For fifteen
years she had contrived to keep pleasant people and
youthful faces for the most part outside any house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
occupied by Miss Glenlyne. That lady had descended
the vale of years in company with pilgrims almost
as travel-worn and as near the end of the journey as
herself: no reflected light from the countenances of
younger travellers had been permitted to shine upon
her. Kensal-green and Doctors’-commons—all images
that symbolise approaching death—had been
kept rigorously before her. Youth had been represented
to her as the period of deceit and ingratitude.
If any young person, by some fortuitous means, did
ever penetrate her seclusion, Miss Spilling immediately
discovered that young person to be a viper in
disguise—a reptile which would warm itself at Miss
Glenlyne’s hearth, only to sting its benefactress.
And Miss Glenlyne, always uncomfortably conscious
that she had money to bequeath, and that humanity
is sometimes mercenary, had discarded one acquaintance
after another, at the counsel of Miss Spilling,
until she found herself in extreme old age with no
companionship save the somewhat doleful society
of her counsellor.</p>

<p>It was wonderful how brisk and light the old lady
became in her niece’s company. She made Lucille
sit next her, and patted the girl’s hand with her
withered fingers, on which the rings rattled loosely,
and asked her all manner of questions about her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
childhood and her schooldays, her accomplishments,
her vague memory of mother and father.</p>

<p>‘I’ve a portrait of your father in the dining-room,’
she said; ‘you shall go down and look at it
by and by.’</p>

<p>Lucius returned with Janet, whom Miss Glenlyne
welcomed with much cordiality, evidently struck
by the beauty of that noble face which had beguiled
Geoffrey Hossack into that not-uncommon folly
called love at first sight. The little dinner in the
back drawing-room was a most cheerful banquet, in
spite of Miss Spilling, who presided grimly over the
dish of chops, and looked the daggers which she
dared not use. Miss Glenlyne even called for a
bottle of champagne, whereupon Miss Spilling reluctantly
withdrew to fetch that wine from the cellaret
in the dining-room. Unwelcome as was the
task, she was glad of the opportunity to retire, that
she might vent her grief and indignation in a series
of sniffs, groans, and snorts, which seemed to afford
her burdened spirit some relief.</p>

<p>After dinner Miss Glenlyne asked Janet to sing,
and they all sat in the firelight listening to those old
Italian airs which seem so full of the memory of
youth; and warmed by these familiar melodies—rich
and strong as old wine—Miss Glenlyne discoursed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
of her girlhood and the singers she had heard at His
Majesty’s Theatre.</p>

<p>‘I have heard Pasta, my dear, and Catalani, and
I remember Malibran’s <em>début</em>. Ah, those were grand
days for opera! You have no such singers nowadays,’
said Miss Glenlyne, with the placid conviction which
is sustained by ignorance.</p>

<p>‘You ought to hear some of our modern singers,
Miss Glenlyne,’ replied Lucius; ‘all the great people
come to Brighton to sing nowadays.’</p>

<p>‘I never go out except for an hour in my bath-chair,
and I am sure you have no one like Pasta.
Your sister has a lovely voice, Mr. Davoren, and a
charming style, quite the old school. She reminds
me of Kitty Stephens. But as to your having any
opera-singer like those I heard in my youth, I can’t
believe it.’</p>

<p>When the time drew near for her guests to depart,
Miss Glenlyne grew quite melancholy.</p>

<p>‘You have cheered me up so, my dear,’ she said
to Lucille. ‘I can’t bear to lose you so quickly. I
never took such a fancy to any one—since I lost your
mother,’ she added in a whisper.</p>

<p>‘Lor, Miss Glenlyne,’ exclaimed Miss Spilling,
unable to command her indignation, ‘you’re always
taking fancies to people.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span></p>

<p>‘And you’re always trying to set me against
them,’ answered her mistress; ‘but this young lady
is my own flesh and blood—I’m not going to be
turned against her.’</p>

<p>‘I’m sure I’ve always spoken from a sense of
duty, Miss Glenlyne.’</p>

<p>‘I suppose you have. But it is your duty to
respect my niece. I am an old woman, Mr. Davoren,
and I don’t often ask favours,’ continued Miss
Glenlyne, appealing to Lucius. ‘I think you ought
to indulge my fancy, if you can possibly do so without
injury to any one else.’</p>

<p>‘What is your fancy, Miss Glenlyne?’</p>

<p>‘I want Lucille to stay with me a little while—till
we have learnt to know each other quite well. I
am the only near relation she has, and my time
cannot be very long now. If she doesn’t gratify her
old aunt on this occasion, she may never have the
opportunity again. Who can tell how soon I may
be called away?’</p>

<p>This from one who was between seventy and
eighty was a forcible appeal. Lucius looked at Lucille
with an interrogative glance.</p>

<p>‘I should like very much to stay,’ said Lucille,
answering the mute question, ‘if you think grandpapa
would not be offended or inconvenienced.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span></p>

<p>‘I think I could explain everything to Mr. Sivewright,
and that he could hardly object to your stopping
here for a few days,’ replied Lucius.</p>

<p>‘Then she shall stay!’ exclaimed Miss Glenlyne,
delighted. ‘Spilling, tell Mary to get a room ready
for Miss Lucille—the room opening out of mine.’</p>

<p>Spilling, with a visage gloomy as Cassandra’s,
retired to obey. It was nearly the time for Janet
and Lucius to depart, in order to catch a convenient
train for their return. Lucille wrote a little note to
Mrs. Milderson, asking for a small portmanteau of
necessaries to be sent to her; and then with a tender
hand-pressure, and a kiss on the landing outside the
drawing-room, the lovers parted for a little while,
and Lucille was left alone with her great-aunt. It
was a strangely sudden business, yet there was
something in the old lady’s clinging affectionateness
that attached the girl to her already. She
seemed like some one who had long pined for some
creature to love, and who had found her desire in
Lucille.</p>

<p>Miss Spilling retired to the housekeeper’s room—a
snug little apartment in the basement—and
sat with her feet on the fender, consuming buttered
toast and strong tea, and talking over this new state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
of affairs with the cook, while Lucille and Miss Glenlyne
had the drawing-room all to themselves.</p>

<p>‘Do you really believe as how she is missus’s
niece?’ asked the cook, when she had heard Miss
Spilling’s recital.</p>

<p>‘No more than you are, Martha,’ answered the
indignant Spilling. ‘Only she’s more artful than
the common run of impostors, and she’s backed up
by that letter of Mr. Pullman’s. We all know what
lawyers are, and that <em>they’ll</em> swear to anything.’</p>

<p>‘But what would Mr. Pullman gain by it, miss?’</p>

<p>‘Who knows? That’s his secret. There’s some
plot hatching between ’em all, and Mr. Pullman lends
himself to it, and wants Miss Glenlyne to leave her
money to this young woman—and he’s to get half of
it, I daresay.’</p>

<p>‘Ah,’ said cook sententiously, ‘it’s a wicked
world!’</p>

<p>And then Miss Spilling and the cook began to
talk of Miss Glenlyne’s will—a subject which they
had worn threadbare long ago, but to which they
always returned with equal avidity.</p>

<span class="fs70">GEOFFREY HAS THOUGHTS OF SHANGHAI.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Cheered</span> and sustained by the hope of another
happy afternoon with Janet in the little cottage
parlour, Geoffrey Hossack made himself wonderfully
agreeable to his cousins Belle and Jessie, and
shot the game on his uncle’s estate, and on the
estates of his uncle’s neighbours, with a good will.
He was always popular, and in this part of Hampshire
he was accepted as a product of the soil, and
cherished accordingly. His father had been liked
before him, and people expressed their regret that
an alien trader should occupy the house where that
gentleman had once dispensed what our ancestors
were wont to call an elegant hospitality.</p>

<p>‘O, I mean to marry, and turn out the sugar-broker
some day,’ Geoffrey would reply in answer to
these friendly speeches. Whereat Belle and Jessie
would both blush, and look at each other, and then
at the carpet. So bright a spot had that rustic tea-drinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
made in the life of this infatuated gentleman,
that the sunshine lingered after the event, and
the mere memory of that one happy hour with Janet
made life pleasant to him for a long time. Belle
and Jessie noticed his high spirits, and each flattered
herself with the idea that it was her society which
gladdened him. And when they ‘talked him over,’
as they called it, at hair-brushing time, they in a
manner congratulated each other upon his ‘niceness,’
just as if he were a kind of common property,
and could marry both of them. He had still one
tiresome trick, and that was a habit of rambling off
for long solitary walks, in what the sisters considered
a most unsociable spirit.</p>

<p>‘It’s about the only thing I can do on my own
hook,’ this unpolite young man answered upon being
remonstrated with. ‘If I go out shooting, you go
too; if I go on the water, you pull a better stroke
than I do; if I play bowls, you play bowls. You
don’t smoke, but you are kind enough to come and
sit with me in the smoking-room. So my only
chance of doing a little thinking is a solitary walk.
I suppose you don’t pedestrianise? Twenty miles a
day might be too much for you.’</p>

<p>‘O no, it wouldn’t,’ replied these thoroughbred
damsels. ‘We’re going for a walking tour in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
Isle of Wight next spring, if papa will take us. It
seems absurd that two girls can’t walk alone, but I
suppose it might be thought odd if we went by ourselves.’</p>

<p>Geoffrey uttered a faint groan, but spoke no word.
He was counting the days that must elapse before
he could pay a second visit to Foxley, without stretching
the license Mrs. Bertram had accorded him. His
lonely walks had taken him through Foxley more
than once, and he had lingered a little on the village-green,
and looked at the windows of old Sally’s cottage,
and had longed in vain for but a glimpse of the
face he loved. Fortune did not favour these surreptitious
pilgrimages. Just as he began to think that
the time had come when he might pay his second
visit, and demand that promised cup of orange pekoe,
Lucius Davoren’s letter reached him, and he learned
that Janet’s husband was alive and in England. The
news was a death-blow to his hopes. The man alive
whose death he had vouched for! Alive, and with as
good a life as his own perhaps!</p>

<p>What would Janet think of him should she come
to know this? What could she think, save that he
had deliberately attempted to deceive her? His
honest heart sank at the thought that she might
deem him guilty of such baseness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span></p>

<p>What should he do? Go straightway to her, and
tell her that he had been deceived; that if her marriage
was indeed legal, his love was hopeless. Yes,
he would do that. Anything would be better than to
hazard being scorned by her. He would go to her,
and tell her the bitter truth, so far as the one fact
that her husband was alive. The details of the story—all
that concerned the villain’s supposed death in
the American forest—must remain untold till he
had Lucius’s permission to reveal it.</p>

<p>He set off upon his lonely walk to Foxley with a
heavy heart—a soul which the varied beauty of autumnal
woods, the shifting lights and shadows upon
the undulating stubble, could not gladden. His case
had seemed hopeless enough a little while ago, so
steadfast was Janet’s determination to hear no word
of a second marriage till she had convincing proof
that Death had cancelled the first; but it seemed
ever so much more hopeless now, after this assurance
from Lucius that the man was alive. And as
a mere basis for speculation, where ages are equal,
one man’s life is as good as another.</p>

<p>‘I daresay that beggar’s ten years my senior,’
pondered Geoffrey as he strode along the rustic lanes,
where ripening blackberries hung between him and
the sharp clear air; ‘but for all that I’ll be bound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
he’ll outlive me. If he hadn’t more lives than a cat,
he’d hardly have escaped Davoren’s bullet, and the
sharp tooth of Jack Frost into the bargain. I suppose
he keeps Death at a distance by the awe-inspiring
sounds of that fiddle, like Orpheus with
his lyre.’</p>

<p>Geoffrey had made up his mind to a desperate
step. He would do that which must needs be as
bitter as self-inflicted martyrdom. He would tell
what he had to tell, and then take a lifelong leave of
the woman he loved. Vain, worse than vain, the
poor pretence of friendship where his heart was so
deeply engaged. Platonism here would be the hollowest
falsehood. With heart, soul, and mind he
loved her, and for such love as his there was no
second name. Better the swift and sudden death of
all his joys than that his agonies should be protracted
by such occasional meetings as Janet might
be disposed to permit—meetings in which he must
school his lips to the formal language of polite conversation,
while his heart burned to pour out its
wealth of passionate love.</p>

<p>Foxley wore its accustomed aspect of utter peacefulness.
The same donkey, hampered as to the hind
legs, grazed on the village-green; the happy geese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
who had escaped the sacrificial spit at fatal Michaelmas
hissed their unfriendly salutation to the stranger.
Nothing seemed changed, save that the late-lingering
roses looked pale and pinched by the frosty breath of
autumnal mornings; and even the dahlias had a
weedy look, like fashionable beauties at the close of
the London season.</p>

<p>Flossie was skipping in the little garden-path,
with much exhibition of her scarlet stockings, which
flashed gaily from the snow-white drapery of daintily-embroidered
petticoats.</p>

<p>‘Well, my little red-legged partridge,’ cried
Geoffrey, ‘and where is mamma?’</p>

<p>‘Mamma has gone to London,’ answered Flossie,
with the callousness of childhood.</p>

<p>Geoffrey turned pale. He had come on purpose
to be miserable—to utter words which must be sharp
as Moorish javelins to pierce his own heart. Yet,
not finding Janet, he felt as deeply disappointed as
if his errand had been the happiest. And Flossie’s
calm announcement kindled a spark of jealousy in
his breast. ‘To London, and why?’ was his first
question. ‘To London, and with whom?’ was his
second.</p>

<p>‘A boy brought a nasty wicked letter, in a yellow
envelope, from the railway-station,’ said Flossie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
making a face expressive of supreme disgust; ‘and
mamma went away directly. Poor mamma was so
pale, and trembled as she put on her bonnet, and I
cried when she went. But old Sally is ever so kind
to me, and I’m happy now.’</p>

<p>‘Shallow, fickle child!’ cried Geoffrey; ‘take me
to old Sally.’</p>

<p>Flossie conducted him through the pretty little
parlour he remembered so well, across a tiny kitchen—neat
as the kitchen of a doll’s house and not
much bigger—to the garden behind the cottage,
where old Sally stood boldly out on a bit of high
ground, cutting winter cabbages, and in a bonnet
which she wore like a helmet.</p>

<p>She was not a little surprised and confused by
the apparition of a tall young gentleman in her back
garden; but on recovering her fluttered spirits, told
Geoffrey what he so ardently desired to know.</p>

<p>‘The telegraft was from Mr. Lucius,’ she said,
‘and Miss Janet was to go up to London by the first
train that left Foxley-road station. I asked her if
Mr. Lucius was ill, and she says No. “But somebody
is ill, Sarah,” she says, “and I must go at once.”
And she leaves all of a maze like, poor dear young
lady! So I ups and runs to Mr. Hind, at the farm,
and asks the loan of his wagonette and man; and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
man drove Miss Janet and the other young lady off
in time to catch the twelve-o’clock train.’</p>

<p>‘Some one ill,’ thought Geoffrey. ‘Who could
that have been? I have heard her say she had no
one in the world to care for except Flossie and her
brother Lucius.’</p>

<p>‘Have you heard nothing since she left you?’ he
asked.</p>

<p>‘Lor bless her dear heart, o’ course I have!’
answered the old woman, picking up her greenstuffs,
which she had dropped in her embarrassment at
Geoffrey’s abrupt appearance. ‘I had a sweet letter
telling me as she was going to stop a few days up in
London with her brother. A nice change for her,
poor dear!’ added Sally, whose rustic idea of London
was a scene of perpetual enchantment; ‘and telling
me to take care of little missy; and I do take care
of her, don’t I, dear?’ she said, looking benevolently
down at Flossie, who was hanging affectionately to
her apron; ‘and little missy and me are going to
have a nice bit of biled bacon and greens and a apple
dumpling for our dinner.’</p>

<p>This was quite enough for Geoffrey. He immediately
determined to follow Janet to London, see
her under her brother’s roof, and there hear from
Lucius all that he could tell about Matchi or Vandeleur’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
reappearance. His friend’s letter had told
him so little. It would be some satisfaction to
know what ground Lucius had for his belief that
Matchi still lived.</p>

<p>‘There is an up-train from Foxley-road station at
one o’clock, you say?’ he said, looking at his
watch. It was now a quarter to twelve.</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir.’</p>

<p>‘And how far is the station from here?’</p>

<p>‘About three miles.’</p>

<p>‘Good, I can walk that easily. I’m going to
London to see mamma, Flossie. Have you any
message for her?’</p>

<p>‘Only that she is to come back directly, and give
her fifty kisses.’</p>

<p>‘You must give me the kisses first.’</p>

<p>Flossie obeyed, and counted out her fifty kisses
methodically in the region of Mr. Hossack’s left
whisker. Thus furnished, he set out again, directed
by Sally, to walk to the Foxley-road station.</p>

<p>It was hardly a polite manner in which to depart
from Hillersdon, but Geoffrey relied upon a telegram
to set himself right with his uncle and cousins ere
they should have time to be inconvenienced or offended
by his departure. A telegram from London,
stating that important business had summoned him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
there, would be ample explanation, he considered.
And the leaving behind of his portmanteaus made
little difference to him, since he always had a collection
of clothes, boots, brushes, and other toilet implements,
in his own particular room at the Cosmopolitan,
neatly stowed away in drawers inaccessible
to less-privileged patrons of that house.</p>

<p>The train which called at Foxley-road was a
farmers’ train, stopped at every station, and performed
the journey in a provokingly deliberate style.
Not till it had passed Guildford did the engine
hasten, and when Waterloo did at last loom upon
his weary gaze, smoke-veiled and dingy, Mr. Hossack
thought the journey one of the longest he had ever
endured.</p>

<p>He only stopped long enough to write a plausible
and explanatory telegram for the pacification of his
cousin Belle before plunging into a hansom, whose
charioteer he directed to the Shadrack-road. That
cab-ride through the busiest thoroughfares of the
City was also tedious; but as the streets and the atmosphere
grew duller and smokier hope brightened,
and he knew that he was nearing his goal. He was
only going, as it were, in search of misery, yet he
had a wild longing to see the dear face, even though
it was to shine upon him for the last time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span></p>

<p>The charioteer was tolerably quick of comprehension,
and did not make above three false stoppages
before he drew up opposite Lucius Davoren’s gate,
with the big brass plate which bore his name and
titles. It was growing dusk by this time, so long
had been the journey, and the comfortable gleam of
firelight shone through the parlour-window. That
genial glow seemed to betoken occupation. She
was there most likely. Geoffrey’s heart beat strong
and fast.</p>

<p>An old woman with a clean white cap—Mrs.
Wincher <em>vice</em> Mrs. Babb dismissed—opened the door.
Was Mr. Davoren at home? Yes. Was anybody
with him? Yes, Mrs. Bertram, his sister. Geoffrey
dashed back to the cab, blindly thrust some loose
silver into the cabman’s hand, and dismissed him
elated, with at least double his fare, and then, this
duty done, he walked into the parlour.</p>

<p>The room looked curiously changed since he had
seen it last. The furniture was the same, no doubt;
the same dull red-and-brown paper lined the narrow
walls; yet everything had a brighter look—a look that
was even homelike. A fire burned cheerily in the
small grate, a tea-tray stood ready on the table;
Lucius sat on one side of the hearth, Janet on the
other. She wore a black dress, against whose dense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
hue her complexion showed pure as marble. They
both looked up, somewhat startled by the opening of
the door—still more startled when they recognised
the intruder. Lucius had a guilty feeling. In the
excitement of the last fortnight he had forgotten all
about Geoffrey.</p>

<p>‘Dear old Geoff!’ he exclaimed, speedily recovering
from that sense of guilt. ‘How good of you to
turn up in such an unexpected way! Where have
you come from?’</p>

<p>‘Hillersdon—Foxley-road, that is to say. I called
at Foxley this morning, Mrs. Bertram, and not finding
you, ventured to come on here.’</p>

<p>Janet blushed, but answered not a word.</p>

<p>‘You’ve just come from Foxley?’ cried Lucius;
‘there never was such a fellow for tearing up and
down the earth, except that person who must be
nameless. You haven’t dined, of course? You shall
have some chops. Ring the bell, Janet; that one
on your side of the fire does ring, if you give the
handle a good jerk. Dear old Geoff, it is so good
of you to come, and I’ve so much to tell you.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ answered Geoffrey with a gloomy look,
‘I got your letter. It was that which brought me
here.’</p>

<p>‘Wonderful things have happened since I wrote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
that letter, Geoff. But let me see about your dinner,
and we’ll talk seriously afterwards.’</p>

<p>Geoffrey made no objection. He sat in a shadowy
corner, silent, stealing a look at the face he
loved every now and then, and very despondent in
spirit. He was with her once more, and now began
to ask himself how he could ever bid her that lifelong
farewell he had thought of. No, he could never
so sacrifice his own fondest desires. If it were but a
crumb she could give him, he would take that crumb
and be passably content. He would be like Dives
in the place of torment, and if he could not have that
nectar-draught for which his soul languished, he
would ask for but one drop of water. He would not
be self-banished from the light; better even that he
should be consumed—annihilated—by its too vivid
glory.</p>

<p>These were his thoughts while Lucius, provokingly
practical, was giving orders for chops and
rashers and poached eggs to Mrs. Wincher, who had
made a complete transformation in her personal appearance
to do honour to her new situation, and now
wore a white cap and a clean linen apron, in place
of the crumpled black bonnet and sage-green half-shawl
which had been her distinguishing marks in
Cedar House.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span></p>

<p>Jacob Wincher came in, while his good lady was
cooking chops and rashers, and laid the cloth neatly,
placing the tea-tray on one side of the table. He
handled things as deftly as if he had been all his
life languishing to be a butler, and only now found
his right position in the world. To serve Lucius
was a labour of love with both these people.
He had wronged them, and generously atoned for
the wrong he had done, and it seemed as if the
wrong and the atonement had endeared him to
them.</p>

<p>Jacob drew the curtains, lighted the candles, and
made all snug just as Mrs. Wincher bumped against
the door with the dishes. The chops were perfection,
the eggs and bacon fit for a picture of still life,
the crusty loaf a model for all bakers to imitate
who would achieve renown in neighbourhoods where
bread is verily the staff of life.</p>

<p>Janet made the tea, and at sight of her seated by
the tea-tray Geoffrey’s spirits in some measure revived.
He relegated that question of lifelong adieu
to the regions of abstract thought. His countenance
brightened. He gave Janet Flossie’s message about
the fifty kisses; at which the mother smiled and
asked many eager questions about her darling.</p>

<p>‘I am going back to my pet to-morrow,’ she said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
‘It is the first time we were ever parted, and it has
been a hard trial for me.’</p>

<p>‘Should I be impertinent if I asked why you
came so suddenly to London?’ Geoffrey inquired.</p>

<p>A pained look came into Janet’s face.</p>

<p>‘I came upon a sorrowful errand,’ she answered;
‘Lucius can tell you about it by and by.’</p>

<p>‘You are in mourning for some one who has
died lately,’ hazarded Geoffrey, with a glance at that
black dress about which he had been puzzling himself
considerably.</p>

<p>‘I am in mourning for my husband, who died
only a week ago,’ Janet answered quietly.</p>

<p>The blow was almost too sudden. Great joys are
overwhelming as great sorrows. Geoffrey, the strong,
manly, joyous-hearted Geoffrey, grew pale to the
lips. He got up from his chair, and gave a struggling
gasp, as if striving for breath.</p>

<p>‘Janet, is it true?’ he asked, lest he should be
the victim of some cruel deception.</p>

<p>‘It is quite true, Mr. Hossack,’ she answered;
the coldness of her tone rebuking the ardour of his.
‘My husband is dead. His death was as unhappy
as his life was guilty. It pains me to remember
either.’</p>

<p>Geoffrey was silent. He scarcely dared open his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
lips lest his joy should gush forth in ill-considered
words. He could not look sorry, or even sympathetic.
As a last resource, in this conflict of emotions, he
devoured a mutton-chop, with no more sense of the
operation of eating than if he had been a brazen idol
whose jaws were worked by machinery.</p>

<p>That tea-party was curiously silent, though Lucius
did now and then attempt to promote conversation
by a somewhat feeble remark. Directly the
meal was over, Geoffrey rose from the table, no longer
able to support the intensity of his own feelings, and
bursting with impatience to question his friend.</p>

<p>‘Let’s go outside and have a smoke, Lucius,’ he
said; ‘that is to say, if Mrs. Bertram will excuse
us,’ he added with a deprecating look at Janet.</p>

<p>‘Pray do not consider me,’ she answered. ‘I am
going to my room to pack my portmanteau for to-morrow.
You can smoke here, if you like. I have
become accustomed to the smell of tobacco since I
have been staying with Lucius.’</p>

<p>‘Poor Janet. I’ve been rather too bad; but it’s
such a treat to have you sitting opposite me while
I smoke.’</p>

<p>She smiled at her brother, the first smile Geoffrey
had seen on that pale serious face, and left them.
Privileged by her permission, they drew their chairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
to the fender. Lucius filled his favourite pipe, and
Geoffrey drew a cigar from a well-supplied case.</p>

<p>‘For heaven’s sake tell me all about it,’ said
Geoffrey, directly Jacob Wincher had retired, staggering
a little under the burden of the tea-tray. ‘Thank
God she is free! She is free, and I may hope! I
didn’t like to be too grateful to Providence in her
presence. A woman’s tender heart will lament even
a scoundrel when the grave closes upon him. Tell
me everything, Lucius; but first tell me why you
did not write me word of this man’s death. You
wrote fast enough to tell me he was alive; why not
write to announce the blessed fact of his departure?’</p>

<p>‘For the simple reason that I forgot the necessity
for such a letter. Janet’s husband died only ten
days ago, and his death involved me in a good deal
of business. There was the inquest, and then came
the funeral. Yesterday I had to go down to Brighton,
to-day I had an interview with a lawyer.’</p>

<p>‘An inquest!’ exclaimed Geoffrey. ‘Then that
fellow came to a violent end after all.’</p>

<p>‘A violent and a strange end,’ answered his
friend, and then proceeded to narrate the circumstances
of Ferdinand Sivewright’s death, and to acquaint
Geoffrey with the link which had bound
Lucille to his sister’s husband. Geoffrey listened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
with patient attention. The main fact that this
man was dead, and Janet free to marry whomsoever
she pleased, was all-sufficient for his contentment.
The serenity of disposition which had made him so
pleasant a companion in days of hardship and trial
once more asserted itself. Geoffrey Hossack was
himself again.</p>

<p>‘Do you think there’s any hope for me?’ he
asked, when Lucius had told all he had to tell.</p>

<p>‘Hope of what?’</p>

<p>‘That Janet will reward my devotion?’</p>

<p>‘In due time, I daresay, such a thing may be
possible,’ answered Lucius, with provoking deliberation;
‘but you had better refrain from any allusion
to such hopes for some time to come.’</p>

<p>‘How long now? What’s the fashionable period
of mourning for a young widow whose husband was
a scoundrel? Six weeks, is it? or three months?
And does society demand as long a period of mourning
for its scoundrels as for its most estimable men?’</p>

<p>‘If it were not so near winter, Geoffrey, I should
recommend you to do a few months in Norway; or,
as you are so near the docks, why not take a run to
Shanghai in one of those splendid China steamers—three
hundred and fifty feet from stem to stern? You
might by that means escape the winter; or, if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
don’t care about Shanghai, you can stop at Port
Said, and do a little of Egypt.’</p>

<p>‘I’ve done the Pyramids and Pompey’s Pillar,
and all that kind of thing,’ answered Geoffrey with a
wry face. ‘Do the laws of society demand my departure?’</p>

<p>‘I think it would be better for you to be away
for six months or so, dear old fellow,’ answered
Lucius kindly. ‘You are such an impetuous spoiled
child of fortune, and I know you will be fretting and
fuming, and perhaps injuring your cause with Janet
by too hasty a wooing. She is a woman of deep feeling.
Give her time to recover from the shock of
Sivewright’s death; and be sure that I will guard
your interests in the mean time. No other than
Geoffrey Hossack shall ever call me brother.’</p>

<p>‘It’s very good of you to say that,’ replied Geoffrey
gratefully. ‘But you may be promising too
much. Suppose some confoundedly agreeable fellow
were to make up to your sister while I was at Shanghai,
and the first thing I saw when I came back to
England, in the <cite>Times</cite>, were the announcement of
her marriage?’</p>

<p>‘If that were possible, she would not be worthy
of you, and you’d be better off without her,’ replied
Lucius.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span></p>

<p>‘Perhaps. But I’d rather have her, even if she
were capable of doing that, so long as she hadn’t
done it.’</p>

<p>‘There you get metaphysical, and I can barely
follow you. But I’ll stake my own chances of happiness
upon Janet’s constancy, even though no pledge
has ever passed between you. I’ll go so far as to
postpone my own marriage for the next six months,
so that you may be married on the same day, if you
like.’</p>

<p>‘There seems something like assurance in such
an offer as that,’ answered Geoffrey, ‘but I won’t
fetter you. I shouldn’t like to be a stumbling-block
in the way of your happiness. I’ll go straight to
Shanghai. I think you’re right; I should fret and
fume, and perhaps annoy Janet with my obnoxious
presence if I were to remain within reach of her,
walk up and down under her windows, and make
myself otherwise objectionable. I’d better go to
Shanghai. Yet it is hard to leave her without one
word of hope from her own dear lips. You’ll let me
say good-bye, Lucius?’</p>

<p>‘Neither Janet nor I could very well refuse you
so slight a boon.’</p>

<p>Janet reëntered just as this discussion finished.
The pale calm face had a tranquilising effect upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
Geoffrey’s excited nerves. He had been pacing the
room in a distracted manner, hardly able to smoke;
but at sight of Janet he flung his cigar into the
fender, and became a reasonable being.</p>

<p>They talked a little, quietly, of indifferent things,
and a good deal about Flossie, an ever-delightful subject
to the fond mother; and then Geoffrey, feeling
that it was growing late and that duty demanded
self-sacrifice, rose and said something about going
away. Happily there came a reprieve in the shape
of an offer of brandy-and-soda from Lucius, who
rang the bell for his ancient seneschal; so Geoffrey
lingered just a little longer and took heart of grace
to tell Janet his intention of a speedy voyage eastward.</p>

<p>‘Lucius seems to think I oughtn’t to idle about
London all the winter,’ he said, ‘and suggests a trip
to China—a mere bagatelle—fifty days out and fifty
days home, and a week or so to look about one while
the steamer coals, and so forth. Yet it makes a hole
in a year, and it is sad to leave one’s friends even
for so short a time.’</p>

<p>‘Are you really going to China?’ asked Janet,
opening those splendid eyes of hers in calmest astonishment.</p>

<p>Geoffrey wavered immediately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span></p>

<p>‘Well, Lucius advises me, you see,’ he replied
irresolutely; ‘but I don’t know that I care much
about China. And as to going about in steamers
just because steamers can give you all the comforts
you can get at home, why not stay at home at once
and enjoy the comforts without the steamer? And
as to China—it sounds interesting in the abstract;
but really, on second thoughts, I can’t perceive any
gratification in visiting a country in which men have
pigtails and women crumpled feet. One is brought
up with a vague idea of the China Wall and Crim
Tartary, which, as one grows to manhood, gives
place to another vague idea of the Caucasus, and the
river Amoor, and Russian aggression, and some vast
uncomfortable territory lying between Russia and
India, just as Bloomsbury lies between the West-end
and the City, and I daresay almost as impassable.
No, I really don’t see why I should go to Shang-kong—I
beg your pardon—Honghai,’ faltered Geoffrey,
brightening at Janet’s kindly smile; ‘I think
a little hunting at Stillmington would do me more
good.’</p>

<p>‘Stop at home, then, Geoff,’ said Lucius, laughing
at his faithful comrade, ‘and have your season
in the shires. Janet shall stay and keep house for
me till I marry.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span></p>

<p>‘What! is Mrs. Bertram going to stop with you?’</p>

<p>‘For a little while,’ answered Janet; ‘I don’t
think this part of town would do for Flossie very
long; but I am going to fetch her to-morrow, and
she and I are to keep house for Lucius for a month
or two.’</p>

<p>‘And then we are all going to migrate to the
West-end together,’ said Lucius.</p>

<p>Geoffrey sighed and looked miserable.</p>

<p>‘How pleasantly you lay your plans!’ he said;
‘and I stand quite alone in the world and belong to
nobody. I think I shall go down to the docks to-morrow
morning and pick my berth on board a China
steamer.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t,’ said Janet gently. ‘Go to Stillmington
and enjoy yourself hunting those unhappy foxes;
and then, since you are always restless, you can
come up to town sometimes and give us an account
of your sport.’</p>

<p>This permission exalted Geoffrey to the seventh
circle in the lover’s paradise. It seemed to him like
a promise.</p>

<span class="fs70">LUCIUS SURRENDERS A DOUBTFUL CHANCE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Lucius</span> saw Mr. Pullman next day, and told him of
the impression Lucille had made on her great-aunt.</p>

<p>‘Upon my word, sir, she’s a very lucky young
woman,’ said the lawyer; ‘for Miss Glenlyne has a
snug little fortune to dispose of, and has not a near
relative to leave it to; for the Spalding Glenlynes
are only third or fourth cousins, and she detests
them. Now, Mr. Davoren, do you mean to put forward
Miss Lucille Glenlyne’s claim to the estate
now in the possession of Mr. Spalding Glenlyne?’</p>

<p>‘That will depend on various circumstances, Mr.
Pullman,’ answered Lucius. ‘First and foremost,
you think the case a weak one.’</p>

<p>‘Lamentably weak. You are able to prove the
marriage;—granted. You may be able to prove the
birth of a child; but how are you to identify the
young lady you put forward with the child born at
Sidmouth? How are you to supply the link which
will unite the two ends of the chain?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span></p>

<p>‘Miss Glenlyne has acknowledged her niece.’</p>

<p>‘Yes; but let Miss Glenlyne come forward to
bear witness to her niece’s identity, and she will be
laughed at as a weak old woman—almost an idiot.
The only person who could have sworn to the girl’s
identity was Ferdinand Sivewright. He is dead,
and you did not even take his deposition to the facts
within his knowledge. Even had you done so, such
a document might have been useless; the man’s
notoriously bad character would have vitiated his
testimony. Mr. Davoren, I regret to say your case
is as weak as it well can be. It is a case which a
speculative attorney might take up perhaps, hazarding
his not too valuable time and trouble against the
remote contingency of success; but no respectable
firm would be troubled with such a business, unless
you could guarantee their costs at the outset.’</p>

<p>‘I am not greedy for money, Mr. Pullman,’ replied
Lucius, in no manner crestfallen at this disheartening
opinion. ‘Were my case, or rather
Lucille’s case, the strongest, it would still be doubtful
with me how far I should do battle for her interests.
She has been acknowledged by her great-aunt
as a Glenlyne—that is the chief point in my mind.
The name so long lost to her has been restored, and
she has found a relative whose kindness may in some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
measure atone for her father’s cruelty. This Mr.
Spalding Glenlyne acquired the estate by no wrongdoing
of his own. It would be rather hard to oust
him from it.’</p>

<p>‘If you had a leg to stand on, sir, I should be
the last to let any consideration of Mr. Spalding
Glenlyne’s feelings restrain us from taking action
in this matter.’</p>

<p>‘You don’t like Mr. Glenlyne?’</p>

<p>‘Frankly, I detest him.’</p>

<p>‘Is he a bad man?’</p>

<p>‘No, Mr. Davoren; therein lies his most objectionable
quality. He is a man who at once enforces
respect and provokes detestation.’</p>

<p>‘Paradoxical, rather.’</p>

<p>‘I suppose so; but it is strictly true, nevertheless.
Mr. Spalding Glenlyne is a man whom everybody
acknowledges to be a useful member of society.
He has improved the Glenlyne estate to an almost
unprecedented extent. His turnips swell like nobody
else’s turnips; his mangolds would have been
big enough for the stables of Gargantua. One can
only comfort oneself with the reflection that those big
turnips are often watery. His cattle thrive as no
one else’s cattle thrive. He is like the wicked man
in the Psalms, everything flourishes with him. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
when he dies there will be a splendid monument
erected in his honour by public subscription. Yes,
sir, people who abhorred him living will come down
handsomely to pay him posthumous homage.’</p>

<p>‘But a man like that must do some good in his
generation,’ said Lucius; ‘he distributes money—he
employs labour.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, he is no doubt useful. He builds model
cottages. His farm labourers are as sleek as his
other cattle. Churches and schools spring up upon
his estate. He brags and hectors intolerably, but I
daresay he does good.’</p>

<p>‘Let him retain his opportunities of usefulness
then, Mr. Pullman. Were my case so strong as to
make success almost a certainty, I think I would
forego all chance of gaining it as willingly as I forego
an attempt which you assure me would be futile.
Let Mr. Spalding Glenlyne keep the estate which he
is so well able to administer for the advantage of
himself and other people. I will not seek to banish
him and his children from the roof-tree that has
sheltered them for ten prosperous years. The Glenlyne
property would be but a white elephant for
Lucille and me. My heart is in my profession, and
I would infinitely rather succeed in that—even though
success fell far short of hopes which may be somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
too high—than grow the biggest turnips that
ever sprouted from the soil of Norfolk. My dear girl
has been acknowledged by her nearest surviving
relation. That is enough for me.’</p>

<p>‘Upon my word, Mr. Davoren, you’re a noble
fellow,’ exclaimed the lawyer, melted by Lucius’s
earnestness, by tones whose absolute truthfulness even
an attorney could not doubt; ‘and I only wish your
case were a trifle stronger, for it would give me
pleasure to protect your interests. However, the case
is weak, and I think your decision is as worldly
wise as it is generous in spirit, and I can only say,
stick to Miss Glenlyne. She’s a very old lady. She
began life with seven hundred a year of her own, and
has been saving money ever since she was twenty-one.’</p>

<p>‘Neither Lucille nor I belong to the race of
toadies,’ said Lucius; ‘but I am grateful to Providence
for Miss Glenlyne’s ready acknowledgment of
her niece.’</p>

<p>‘I have very little doubt the old lady will act
handsomely towards you both,’ replied the lawyer,
solacing himself with a comfortable pinch of snuff.
He seemed to have taken a wonderful liking to
Lucius, and even asked him to dine, an invitation
which Lucius was unable to accept.</p>

<p>‘I shall not have a leisure hour this week,’ he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
said; ‘and on Sunday I am going down to Brighton
to spend the day with Miss Glenlyne.’</p>

<p>From Lincoln’s-inn Lucius went to Cedar House.
He was especially anxious that Mr. Sivewright should
not think himself neglected during Lucille’s absence.
He found the old man friendly, but depressed. His
son’s sudden reappearance and awful death had
shaken him severely, and, despite his outward stoicism,
and that asperity of manner which it was his
pride to maintain, the hidden heart of the man bled
inwardly.</p>

<p>The wise physician reads the hearts of his
patients almost as easily as he divines their physical
ailments. Lucius saw that an unspoken grief weighed
heavily on the old man’s mind. His first thought
was of the simplest remedies—change of scene—occupation.
That house was full of bitter associations.</p>

<p>‘You are an annual tenant here, I think,’ he
said, when Mr. Sivewright had told him, complainingly,
how a jobbing builder was patching the broken
panelling of his bedroom, by order of the agent, Mr.
Agar.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I only took the place for a year certain,
and then from quarter to quarter. I might have had
it for ten pounds a year less had I been willing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
take a lease. But I was too wise to saddle myself
with the repairs of such a dilapidated barrack.’</p>

<p>‘Then you can leave at any time by the sacrifice
of a quarter’s rent, or by giving a quarter’s notice.’</p>

<p>‘Of course I can, but I am not going to leave.
The house suits my collection, and it suits me.’</p>

<p>‘I fear that you subordinate yourself to your
collection. This house must keep alive painful
memories.’</p>

<p>‘Do you think that fire needs any breath to fan
it?’ asked Homer Sivewright bitterly. ‘Keep alive!
Memory never dies, nor grows weaker in the mind of
age. It strengthens with advancing years, until the
shadows of things gone by seem to the old more real
than reality. The old live in the past as the young
live in the future. I have come to the age of backward-going
thoughts. And it matters nothing what
scenes are round me—what walls shut-in my declining
days. Memory makes its own habitation.’</p>

<p>Finding it vain to press the point just now, and
trusting to the great healer Time, Lucius began to
talk cheerily about Lucille. Mr. Sivewright seemed
heartily glad to hear of Miss Glenlyne’s kindness,
and the probability of fortune following from that
kindness by and by, as the lawyer had suggested.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
There was no touch of jealousy in the old man’s half
regretful tone when he said:</p>

<p>‘She will not quite forget me, I hope, now that
she has this new and wealthy friend. I think I
cling more tenderly to the thought of her now that I
know there is no bond of kindred between us.’</p>

<p>‘Believe me she loves you, and has loved you
always, although you have often wounded her affectionate
heart by your coldness.’</p>

<p>‘That heart shall be wounded no more. She
has never been ungrateful. She has never striven
to trade upon my affection. She has never robbed
me, or lied to me. She is worthy of trust as well as
of love, and she shall have both, if she does not
desert me now that fortune seems to smile upon her.’</p>

<p>‘I will answer for her there. In a very few days
she shall be with you again—your nurse and comforter
and companion.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, she has been all those, and I have tried to
shut my heart against her. I will do so no longer.’</p>

<p>When Lucius paid his next visit upon the following
evening he found the old man in a still softer
mood. Tender thoughts had visited him in the deep
night silence—so long for the sleeplessness of age.</p>

<p>‘I have been thinking a great deal about you
both, you and my granddaughter,’ he said to Lucius,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
and have come to a determination, which is somewhat
foreign to my most cherished ideas, yet which
I believe to be wise.’</p>

<p>‘What is that, my dear sir?’</p>

<p>‘I mean to sell the greater part of my collection.’</p>

<p>‘Indeed, that is quite a new idea!’</p>

<p>‘Yes, but it is a resolution deliberately arrived
at. True that every year will increase the value of
those things, but in the mean time you and Lucille
are deprived of all use of the money they would now
realise. That money would procure you a West-end
practice—would make a fitting home for Lucille. It
would open the turnpike-gates on the great high-road
to success; a road which is cruelly long for the traveller
who has to push his way across ploughed fields and
through thorny hedges, and over almost impassable
dykes, for want of money to pay the turnpikes. Yes,
Lucius, I mean to send two-thirds of my collection
to Christie and Hanson’s as soon as I can revise and
modify my catalogue. You might give me an hour
or so every evening to help me with the task.’</p>

<p>‘I will do anything you wish. But pray do not
make this sacrifice on my account.’</p>

<p>‘It is no sacrifice. I bought these things to sell
again, only I have clung to them with a weak and
foolish affection. The result of that folly has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
that I have lost some of the gems of my collection,
I shall set to work upon a new catalogue this evening.
The task will amuse me. You need not shake your
head so gravely. I promise not to overwork myself.
I will take my time, and have the catalogue finished
when the winter sales begin at Christie’s. I know
the public humour about these things, and the
things which will sell best. The residue I shall
arrange in a kind of museum; and perhaps, some day,
when I am in a particularly good humour, I may be
induced to present this remainder to some Mechanics’
Institution at this end of London.’</p>

<p>‘You could not make a better use of it.’</p>

<p>‘I suppose not. After all, the masses, ignorant
of art as they must needs be, must still be capable
of some interest in relics which are associated with
the past. There is an innate sentiment of beauty in
the mind of man—an innate passion for the romantic
and the ancient which not the most sordid surroundings
can extinguish. I have seen dirty bare-footed
children—wanderers from the purlieus of Oxford-market
or Cleveland-road—flatten their noses against
my window in Bond-street, and gloat over the beauty
of Sèvres and Dresden, as if they had the appreciation
of the connoisseur.’</p>

<p>Lucius encouraged this idea of the East-end<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
museum. He saw that this fancy, and the determination
to dispose of the more saleable portion of
his collection, had already lightened the old man’s
spirits. He agreed in the wisdom of turning these
hoarded and hidden treasures into the sinews of life’s
warfare. He declared himself quite willing to owe
advancement to Mr. Sivewright’s generosity.</p>

<p>The catalogue was begun that very evening; for
Homer Sivewright, once having taken up this idea,
pursued it with extraordinary eagerness. He dictated
a new list of his treasures from the old one, and Lucius
did all the penmanship; and at this employment
they both worked sedulously for two hours, at the
end of which time Lucius ordered his patient off to
bed, and took leave for the night. This went on for
three nights, and on the third, which was Saturday,
the catalogue had made considerable progress. All
those objects which addressed themselves to the
antiquarian rather than to the connoisseur, and all
articles of doubtful or secondary value, Mr. Sivewright
kept back for his East-end Museum. He knew that
the public appreciation of his collection depended
upon its being scrupulously weeded of all inferior
objects. He had been known to amateurs as an infallible
judge; and in this, his final appearance before
the public, he wished to maintain his reputation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span></p>

<p>Lucius left him on Saturday night wonderfully
improved in spirits. That occupation of catalogue-making
had been the best possible distraction. Early
on Sunday morning Lucius started for Brighton, so
early that the hills and downs of Sussex were still
wrapped in morning mists as he approached that
pleasant watering-place. He was in time to take
Lucille to the eleven-o’clock service at the famous
St. Paul’s. It was the first time they had ever gone
to church together, and to kneel thus side by side in
the temple seemed as blissful as it was new to both.</p>

<p>After church they took a stroll by the seaside,
walking towards Cliftonville, and avoiding as much
as possible the Brightonian throng of well-dressed
church-goers, airing their finery on the Parade. They
had plenty to say to each other, that fond lover’s talk
which wells exhaustless from youthful hearts. Miss
Glenlyne rarely left her bedroom—where she muddled
through the morning attended by Spilling—until the
day was half over, so Lucille felt herself at liberty
till two o’clock. As the clock struck two, the lovers
reëntered the shades of Selbrook-place.</p>

<p>Miss Glenlyne was in her favourite chair by the
drawing-room fire, looking much smarter, and sooth
to say even fresher and cleaner, than when Lucius
had last beheld her. This improvement was Lucille’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
work. She had found handsome garments in her
aunt’s roomy wardrobe,—garments left to the despoiling
moth, or discolouring mildew, and had suggested
emendations of all kinds in Miss Glenlyne’s
toilet. Dressed in a pearl-gray watered silk, and
draped with a white china-crape shawl, the old lady
looked far more agreeable than in her dingy black
silk gown and dirty olive-green cashmere. Spilling
had contrived to keep these things out of their
owner’s sight and memory, in the pious hope of
possessing them herself by and by, very little the
worse for wear.</p>

<p>The old lady received Lucius with extreme graciousness.
Spilling was invisible, having been relegated
to her original position of maid, and banished
to the housekeeper’s-room. A nice little luncheon
was served in the back drawing-room, at which Miss
Glenlyne again produced a bottle of champagne, an
unaccustomed libation to the genius of hospitality.
The meal was cheerful almost to merriment, and the
old lady appeared thoroughly to enjoy the novel pleasure
of youthful society. She encouraged the lovers
to talk of themselves, their plans and prospects, cordially
entered into the discussion of their future, and
Lucius perceived, by many a trifling indication,
how firm a hold Lucille had already won upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
her aunt’s heart. After luncheon Miss Glenlyne
would have dismissed them to walk on the
Parade, but Lucille insisted on staying at home
to read to her aunt. She read a good deal of
the <cite>Observer</cite>, through which medium Miss Glenlyne
took the news of the week, in a dry and compressed
form, like Liebig’s Extract. After the <cite>Observer</cite> the
conversation became literary, and Miss Glenlyne gave
them her opinion of the Lake poets, Sir Walter Scott,
Monk Lewis, Byron, Mrs. Radcliffe, and the minor
lights who had illumined the world of letters in her
youth. She clung fondly to the belief that ‘Thalaba’
was better than anything that had been done or ever
could be done by that young man called Tennyson,
with whose name rumour had acquainted her some
years back, but whose works she had not yet looked
into. And finally, for the gratification of the young
folks, she recited, in a quavering voice, Southey’s
famous verses upon ‘Lodore.’</p>

<p>Then came afternoon tea, and it was a pretty
sight for Lucius to behold his dear one officiating
at Miss Glenlyne’s tea-table, whose massive silver
equipage glittered in the ruddy firelight; pretty to
see her so much at her ease in her kinswoman’s home,
and to know that if he had not been able to regain
her birthright for her, he had at least given her back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
her father’s name. Altogether that quiet Sunday afternoon
in Selbrook-place was as pleasant as it was
curious. After the early tea Lucius and Lucille
went out, at Miss Glenlyne’s special request, for half-an-hour’s
walk in the autumn gloaming. Perhaps
autumnal evenings at Brighton are better than they
are anywhere else. At any rate, this one seemed so
to these lovers. There was no sea fog, the newly
lighted lamps glimmered with a pale brightness in
the clear gray atmosphere, the crimson of the setting
sun glowed redly yonder, where the dim outlines of
distant headlands showed like vague purple shadows
against the western sky.</p>

<p>Never had these two been able to talk so hopefully
of the future as they could talk to-night. They
arranged everything during that happy half-hour,
which, brief as it seemed, did in actual time, as computed
by vulgar clocks, stretch itself to nearly an
hour-and-a-half. If Mr. Sivewright carried out his
plan of selling the bric-à-brac, and did verily endow
Lucius with some of the proceeds thereof, he Lucius
would assuredly establish himself in some pleasanter
quarter of London, where his patients would be more
lucrative, yet where he might still be a help and
comfort to the poor, whom this hard-working young
doctor loved with something of that divine affection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
which made Francis of Assisi one of the greatest
among saints. He would set up afresh in a more
airy and cheerful quarter of the great city, and make
a worthy home for his fair young bride.</p>

<p>The girl’s little hand stole gently into his.</p>

<p>‘As if I cared what part of town I am to live in
with you,’ she said fondly. ‘I should be just as
happy in the Shadrack-road as in Cavendish-square,
just as proud of my husband as a parish doctor as I
should be if he were a famous physician. Think of
yourself only, dear Lucius, and of your own power
to do good—not of me.’</p>

<p>‘My darling, the more prominent a man’s position
is the more good he can do, provided it be in
him to do good at all. But depend upon it, Lucille,
if I go to the West-end, I shall not turn my back
upon the sufferings of the East.’</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> is the April of the following year. Mr. Sivewright’s
collection has been sold in February, and
the sale, happening in a halcyon period for the disposal
of bric-à-brac, has justified the collector’s proudest
hopes. He has divided the proceeds into two equal
portions, one of which he has bestowed upon Lucius
as Lucille’s dower; and with a part of this money
Lucius has bought a modest practice, with the potentiality
of unlimited improvement, in a narrow street,
situated in that remote, but not unaristocratic region,
beyond Manchester-square.</p>

<p>It is late in April, Lent is just over; there are
wallflowers for sale on the greengrocers’ stalls, a
perfume of spring in the atmosphere, even at the
eastern end of London. The spar-forests yonder in
the docks rise gaily against a warm blue sky, whence
the smoke clouds have been swept by the brisk
westerly breeze.</p>

<p>Bells are ringing gaily from the crocketed finial of
the little Gothic church whose services Lucius Davoren<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
has been wont faithfully to attend on his lonely
bachelor Sundays; and Lucius, nevermore a bachelor,
leads forth his fair young bride from the same Gothic
temple. Not alone doth he issue forth as bridegroom,
for behind him follow Geoffrey and Janet, who have
also made glad surrender of their individual liberty
before the altar in the rose-coloured light of yonder
Munich window, a rose glow which these happy people
accept as typical of the atmosphere of all their lives
to come. Trouble can scarcely approach those whose
love and faith are founded on so firm a rock.</p>

<p>Lucius has kept his promise, and waited for the
same April sunlight to shine upon Geoffrey’s nuptials
and his own. Miss Glenlyne has been one of the
foremost figures in the little wedding group, and Mr.
Sivewright has stood up before the altar, strong and
solid of aspect as one of the various pillars of the
church, to bestow his adopted granddaughter upon
the man of her choice. Lucille has but one bridesmaid,
in the person of Flossie, who looks like a small
Titania, in her airy dress and wreath of spring
blossoms. Never was there a smaller wedding party
at a double marriage, never a simpler wedding.</p>

<p>They go straight from the church to the old
house in the Shadrack-road, which no persuasion
can induce Mr. Sivewright to abandon. Here, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
the old panelled parlour, endeared to Lucius by the
memory of many a happy hour with his betrothed,
they find a modest banquet awaiting them, and a
serious individual of the waiter-tribe, in respectable
black, who has been sent from Birch’s with the banquet.
Moselle corks fly merrily. Mr. Sivewright
does the honours of the feast as gracefully as if he
had been entertaining his friends habitually for the
last twenty years. Lucille and Lucius go round the
old house for a kind of farewell, but carefully avoid
that one locked chamber which was the scene of Ferdinand
Sivewright’s dreadful fate, and which has
never been occupied since that night.</p>

<p>It is quite late in the afternoon when two carriages
bear the two couples off to different railway
stations: Lucius and Lucille on their way to Stillmington,
where they are to spend their brief honeymoon
of a week or ten days before beginning real and
earnest life in the neatly-furnished, newly papered
and painted house near Manchester-square, where
Mr. and Mrs. Wincher and the inevitable Mercury
are to compose their modest establishment; Geoffrey
and Janet to Dover, whence they are to travel
southwards, to climb Swiss mountains and do Rhine
and Danube ere they return to take possession of
a small but perfect abode in Mayfair, where Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
Hossack is to give musical evenings to her heart’s
content, and where Flossie’s nursery is to be a very
bower of bliss, full to overflowing of Siraudin’s bonbon
boxes and illuminated fairy-tale books.</p>

<p>When Lucius and his bride take leave of Miss
Glenlyne, the old lady, who has ‘borne up,’ as she
calls it, wonderfully hitherto, melts into tears, and
tells them that she means in future to spend the
summer months in London, whether Spilling likes it
or not, that she will take lodgings near Lucille’s new
house, so that her darling may come and make
tea for her every day. And then she adds in a whisper,
that she has made a new will, and made Lucille
her residuary legatee. ‘And except forty pounds a
year to Spilling, and a legacy of fifty to each of the
other servants, every sixpence I have is left to you,
dear,’ she adds confidentially. She squeezes a fifty-pound
note into Lucille’s hand just at the last,
wrapped in a scrap of paper, on which is written in
the old lady’s tremulous hand, ‘For hotel expenses
at Stillmington.’</p>

<p>So they depart, happy, to begin that new life
whose untrodden path to most of this world’s wayfarers
seems somewhat rose-bestrewn. These begin
their journey with a fair promise of finding more
roses than thorns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span></p>

<p>Thus it happens that Mr. Glenlyne Spalding
Glenlyne remains in undisputed possession of his
lands, tenements, and hereditaments, to grow big
turnips, and employ labour, and do good in his generation;
while Lucius, unburdened by superfluous
wealth, yet amply provided against the hazards of
professional income, is left free to pursue that calling
which to him is at once exalted and congenial; and
every one is content.</p>
